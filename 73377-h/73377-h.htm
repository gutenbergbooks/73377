<hr class="r5">
</div>


<p>The author of the ensuing publication was born in Effingham
county, Georgia. His grandfather, Dr. Soda, was a native
of Cologne, an ancient city on the Rhine, in Prussia. Here
educated to the science of physic, he afterwards became a
practicing physician. Rather early in life, he came to the
United States of America, and settled in the city of Savannah,
Georgia, where the remainder of his life, some thirty years,
was spent. Here, and during this time, he practiced in the
medical profession with success and distinction. He married
an American lady, the issue from which consisted in only one
son and one daughter, Robert and Jane Rosettah.</p>

<p>About the year 1830, the latter, with J. G. W. Pitts, were
married in the city of Savannah, Georgia. The result from
this nuptial union is the existence of the “author.” With him,
in 1834, his parents removed from Georgia to Rankin county,
near Brandon, Mississippi; but the wife and mother did not
long survive afterward, as will be seen from the following
record found in the family Bible:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Jane Rosettah Pitts, wife of J. G. W. Pitts, departed
this life the 7th day of January, A. D., 1835, in the 21st year
of her age, after severely suffering under a complicated disease
of two years’ standing, which battled the skill of the best
physicians.”</p>

<p>The author was left an orphan at a very early age—only two
years old. He was consigned over to the guardian care of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
affectionate grandmother, who performed the charge both
creditably to herself and in perfect accord with the welfare of
the infant entrusted to her charge.</p>

<p>He was sent to school as early as convenience would permit,
and, at intervals, continued until the age of twenty-one, when
his friends brought him out for Sheriff of Perry county. At
this period he left the school-room, and forthwith entered on
the canvass, which resulted in his successful election by a
handsome majority.</p>

<p>For some four years he continued in this office, during
which time the painful duty devolved on him of executing
James Copeland, the subject of the present work. Next came
his memorable trial in the city of Mobile, Alabama, to answer
an inveterate prosecution for libel—a trial which involved the
best talent of the bar, and resulted in the conviction of the
author by such means as truly gave only the shadows of victory
to the straining prosecution, and triumph in real substance
to the defence.</p>

<p>At a very early age, the author manifested a preference for
the study of medicine, and in his capacity of Sheriff, his
leisure hours, apart from the requirements of his office, were
spent in making proficiency in his favorite science; and still
more so after his trial—immediately following which he attended
a medical college with ardor and assiduity, and ever
since has been engaged in the practice of his profession.</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, nothing within the sphere of human operations
which more affect the present and future generations,
either for good or evil, than a faithful narration of history and
biography. But the effects, either for better or worse, depend
pretty much on the comments and conclusions of the historian
and biographer themselves. He may have an unprejudiced
mind, he may chronicle the events of a nation faithfully and
correctly, and he may be capable of delineating the mighty
strokes and nicer shades of individual character with all the
force and brilliancy which extraordinary genius can command;
but if his deductions or inferences be unsound or erroneous,
the effects will extend to all parts of society, both the present
and the future.</p>

<p>For instance, and as an illustration, the poet said of Lord
Bacon:</p>

<p class="center">
“The greatest, the wisest, and the <em>meanest</em> of mankind.”<br>
</p>

<p>This is a forcible declaration, and one that belongs to the
true philosophy which others must adopt before they can be
the real benefactors of mankind. Had the poet gone further,
and particularized the conduct of this great man, in what consisted
his exalted virtues, and wherein he has contributed so
much to the benefit of after ages—giving him credit for all
this, and stamping it with true glory, admiration and immortality—holding
up the same as worthy of imitation for
aspiring youth; and then followed by a painful portrayal of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
his enormous vices which have had their share in producing so
much corruption and misery on society at large—making manifest,
according to the declaration of another poet, that “an
honest man is the noblest work of God;” and that it is far
better to be honest, though humble, than to have a combination
of character of all which is great and all which is mean;
let it be repeated, had the poet drawn his lines in some such
manner, far happier might have been the result.</p>

<p>Again, war is the scourge of humanity. Of all woes, there
are none which can be compared to the horrors of protracted
warfare. Neither tongue nor pen can adequately depict the
miseries which flow in the train of consequences. The rust,
disease, exposure and pestilence of camp life; the crowded
hospitals of accumulated wretchedness; the sweat and smoke—the
blood and groans of the red battle-field; these form but
a very small part of the dire afflictions which flow from hostile
collisions of this nature—to say nothing of the burdens entailed
on posterity by waste of treasure—leaving an interminable
debt to oppress generations yet unborn!</p>

<p>Here the fashionable historian has a fine field to work in.
In dazzling colors he gilds and paints in profusion. He largely
expatiates on the stratagems, the manœuvering, and the master
strokes of policy displayed by the commanding General. In
matchless grandeur he draws his lines, made conspicuous by
gleaming swords and bristling bayonets. He plants his thundering
batteries on every eminence within the scope of vision.
Now open the scenes of death and carnage. Red flashes, black
smoke and leaden hail extend from every spot of falling conflict.
Hand to hand, foot to foot, breast to breast. First one
and then another of distinguished officers dropping, “covered
all over with immortal glory.” Grounds taken and retaken.
One wing giving away, another pressing victoriously onward
over heaps of the slain. Here stubbornly contested, then
riding on the fiery wings of battle overpowering all opposition—producing
rout, defeat and dreadful slaughter on every road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
of retreat. Such animating descriptions animate other armies
and other Generals. Not only is the impetuous enthusiasm of
the common soldier excited, but also the ardor and emulation
of the General himself. The young, the old—all seem to desire
more opportunities to occur for the exercise of prowess, as
well as for further demonstrations of martial glory. But it is
quite possible to conceive how the historian could have produced
quite a contrary effect. By degrading all that appertains
to warfare, and by holding up to public scorn and
indignation the brutal and hellish scenes involved for purposes
of rapine, plunder or false notions of honor; by descriptions
of this sort war might be held in a very different estimation to
what it now is.</p>

<p>But is the present course of the historian’s pen altogether
erroneous? Perhaps not. The inordinate rapacity and selfishness
of human nature must be taken into account. The overpowering
propensity for conquest, might against right, must
be considered. A nation extremely rich in agricultural productions,
in manufacturing commodities, and in everything
else pertaining to wealth, yet effeminately weak in spirit and
incompetent for physical protection, will stand a poor chance
against the trained hordes who prefer plunder and conquest to
any other pursuit. So far, then, the historian’s pen is not
misapplied in keeping alive and active the bravery and martial
spirit of a nation to secure its own against the unscrupulous
encroachments of other nations, or against the wild infatuations
of parts of the same nation.</p>

<p>In this department the true and correct province of the pen
is to encourage, by all honorable means, bravery, magnanimity,
and all other generous traits of a great nation, consistent with
safety or security in the future, determined to maintain the
right, and equally so not to yield anything to wrong through
abject fear of consequences; at the same time favoring forbearance
and exhausting all honorable means before the last resort
of warfare be put in execution; while not forgetting to impress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
that external warfare or internal rebellion generally leave
behind worse evils than those intended to be removed. A
little reflection, then, must convince all of the vast and mighty
influences which the historian and biographer exercise on
society and nations at large, either for good or evil, according
to the range or sphere occupied.</p>

<p>The life of the condemned criminal, James Copeland, who
expiated his blood-stained career on the scaffold, together with
the history of the alarming and extensive clan, which, for
many long years, produced a perfect reign of terror over such
a broad expanse of territory in this nation, and of which said
James Copeland formed one of the principal leaders in the clan—clearly
showing the causes which favored the progress, as
well as the causes which produced dismemberment and final
dissolution—such a life and history cannot fail, even at this
late date, after so long an interval of unavoidable interruption,
of materially interesting and benefitting the public at large.</p>

<p>James Copeland was executed in 1857. His life and the
history of the clan were published in 1858. The sale of the
work was progressing wonderfully when a ruinous prosecution
commenced against the author in Mobile, in another State,
Alabama, for libel on several parties by the names of Messrs.
Overall, Moulton and Cleaveland; the former being the principal
actor in this prosecution, at least overtly so. This circumstance,
in connection with the crippling of the author’s pecuniary
resources, together with the all-absorbing questions
involved in the late internal war, through which we have just
passed, prevented any but the first edition from appearing,
which only circulated in a very limited extent of territory.</p>

<p>The obstacles here referred to are now pretty much out of
the way. Opportunity is offered for republication on a far
broader basis than before. Time is the corrector of errors
and excesses. Heated passions give way to sober reason. In
the enlarged edition which will shortly appear, impartial minds
will at once discover that the principal object is to do justice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
to all—injury to no one; but this course will not exclude the
guilty from exposure, yet it will endeavor to exonerate the
innocent who may have been accused through misnomer or by
inadvertent mistake.</p>

<p>Great and influential men league together, sometimes for
worthy purposes, but often for unworthy ones. It is very
easy to entertain the idea that a young man just setting out in
the public walks of life without the prestige of the distinguished,
can easily be broken down, no matter how foully the means
resorted to for accomplishment. It is strange that Governor
McWillie, of the State of Mississippi, should have so tamely
and willingly given up the author to the laws of another State,
and more especially to the particular locality where the designing
influence of the prosecutors so widely extended, while well
knowing that the author could have had no motive or interest
in accusing or misrepresenting any—not previously knowing
anything, either of name or person, in relation to the prosecuting
parties, either of good or bad—only publishing in substance
the unaltered revelations as made by the convict himself,
the truth of which he sealed with his last dying breath on the
scaffold; and while Governor McWillie, with hundreds of
others, have known from previous experience the truth of the
principal particulars as related by Copeland himself. This
notorious clan was not only a terror to almost every part of
this State, but also of many others. But all this belongs to
the past, and is only now alluded to in order to give a right
understanding of all the facts and circumstances connected
with the whole affair from beginning to end.</p>

<p>Truth and justice, by oppression and by forces foul, may be
held down for awhile, but the increasing and progressive power
of the springs will break and throw off the impediments—again
bursting forth in vigor and strength not to be crushed
nor repressed by sophistry nor by the influences of money and
distinguished officials.</p>

<p>G. Y. Overall was the principal open prosecutor of the three.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
It was clearly evinced on trial that there were other Overalls,
and, to the satisfaction of the jury, it was to one of these
whom Copeland referred to in his confessions; consequently,
the public sentiment was in no way changed or weakened by
the proceedings of the trial; but, on the contrary, was largely
strengthened in favor of the substantial truths of the confessions.</p>

<p>Hon. P. Walker, the counsel for defense, maintained the same;
and, further, that G. Y. Overall had not a shadow of right on
his side for instituting the prosecution.</p>

<p>The author is frank to confess, from the testimony produced
on trial, that G. Y. Overall established his innocence so far as
he was concerned in point of time as specified in Copeland’s
confessions. But if this had been his only object, why not
have rested satisfied with a verdict in his favor which could
not have failed to have been rendered without any injury to
either the author or the “confessions?” Why did he, in combination
with others, resort to means so disreputable, as will
afterwards be shown, to crush the author or publisher, who before
did not know him, and could not have had any enmity or
sordid motive against him, as well as for the purpose of destroying
the “confessions,” the major parts of which were well
known to be strictly true? Why one part of the witnesses so
infamous and in every way so suspicious? Why the strange
and oscillating conduct of the Judge in varying his charges to
the Jury at different stages of progress? Why, contrary to
all modern usage, hold confined the jury for six long days and
nights with an express and determined resolve not to release
when there appeared to be no prospect of an agreement on a
verdict? Why so many cunning inlets to and tampering with
parts of the jury? Why, when it was worn out by fatigue
and loss of rest, was the last stratagem resorted to for delusion
to the effect that it was hardly worth while holding out
when the penalty, if any at all, would be nothing more than
a slight fine? Why the low, the despicable, and the underground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
agencies set at work to poison the mind of a then intended
wife, and to sever the agreement of marriage which
had been made in good faith on both sides? If G. Y. Overall
had meant nothing more than the establishing of his own innocence
as regards the confessions made, and which he unwarrantedly
applied to himself, why so many mysterious forces
at work and so much of corruption put in play? By endeavoring
to establish too much, reaction often follows which
sometimes satisfies that too little has been effected to produce
any benefit to the complainer.</p>

<p>Public disapproval of the verdict, universal sympathy which
followed the author everywhere, even within the confines of
his prison—a stranger in Mobile, yet on every hand met with
kind treatment both in this city and elsewhere from afar, all
giving testimony against this uncalled for and malignant
prosecution. Mr. Overall and company’s victory was dearly
bought, and left them in a far worse condition than before they
commenced.</p>

<p>For proving too much, a miserable subterfuge was tried to
make appear that Copeland was deranged, was a maniac, and
his statements entirely unworthy of credit. A more signal
failure could not have been attempted. If he was non compos
mentis, the law grievously erred in causing his execution.
Those who knew him well, those who visited him long and
often in his prison, can testify to his extraordinary strength of
mind. Brave and undaunted, affable in deportment, a tenacious
memory, with all other indications of mental vigor, the chances
are very small of making impressions touching his insanity.
And all this in the face of those localities which suffered so
much from the depredations of the clan, which localities can
vouch for the truth of his confessions. But the jury of inquest,
on an artful plea raised at the time of his trial settles
this question. A man with certain death before his eyes,
with not even the remotest hope of any possibility of escape,
is not governed as other men are under ordinary circumstances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
of business and duplicity. If, to the double-dealers and the
reserved, his conduct appears strange in the exposure of his
associates, how much more so in the reflections on his own
mother? The testimony of a dying man, given freely and
without any deceptive or compulsory force, is generally considered
reliable. The circumstances under which he made his
confessions, having in view his fast approaching end to all
earthly scenes, the internal evidences of truth which they
bear, the numerous localities which can confirm the facts as in
them contained, all tend to produce convictions as to the substantial
accuracy of his narrations. In his last moments before
the fatal drop launched him into an endless eternity, in
reference, read the following certificate, correctly transcribed,
as given by an eye witness in reply to an application from the
author:</p>

<p id="CARTERS_CERTIFICATE" class="right">
<span class="smcap">Mobile, Ala.</span>, July 31st. 1873.<br>
</p>

<p>This is to certify that I was present at the execution of
James Copeland, who was executed at Augusta, Perry county,
Miss., the 30th day of October, 1857; and heard the Sheriff, J.
R. S. Pitts, ask him, the said James Copeland, if the detailed
history and list of names given as members of the Wages and
Copeland clan were correct, and he answered the Sheriff in the
affirmative that they were.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 10.5em;"><span class="smcap">T. C. Carter.</span></span><br>
Office 58, North Commerce st., Mobile, Ala.<br>
</p>

<p>Other equally reliable certificates could be given to the same
effect, but the one here transcribed will suffice. The person
whose signature is above given, is respectfully known pretty
much throughout the City of Mobile, as well as over the
greater part of Mississippi, and whose veracity none will
attempt to dispute.</p>

<p>Let it be borne in mind that the existence of this clan continued
for a great number of years, its fields of operations
extended from State to State—from shore to shore. Here
murder and prodigious rapine; there burning wrecks, with
hurried flights from place to place to avoid capture and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
pursuits of retributive vengeance—frequently succeeding, but
now and then failing for short periods of time until the reserves
in men, in money, and in officials or leagued members of the
bar could be brought to bear for rescue or for jail delivery by
process of law. Amid all these chequered scenes of success
and adversity, it would not be impossible for some unintentional
errors of date to have intervened; yet, intrinsically, such
errors may be of a character as not, to the smallest extent, to
affect the validity or value of the “confessions” made; but
still, errors of this sort, may furnish fine capital for indirect
sore-headed associates to rave and foam. As a simple illustration
on this point, one man saw another commit a crime on
the 15th, but, on investigation, it turned out to have been
done on the 16th. Now, had he stated “on or <em>about</em> the
15th,” all would have been complete; but will any one contend
because of the omission of this “<em>or about</em>,” the whole
value of the statement is destroyed?</p>

<p>Again, typographical errors will occur in almost all printed
productions, to a greater or less extent. Such errors are
sometimes insignificant and sometimes material. In the original
work, as first published, some few typographical errors
have been discovered. For instance, “Shonesmack” should
have been Shoemake or Scheumake; but the idea of raising a
fuming warfare because of such sort of errors as these, is
sublimely ridiculous.</p>

<p>After some hesitation about propriety, the author has decided
to re-publish the same as appeared in the first edition,
with such few appended explanations and corrections as are
necessary for distinct comprehension by the reader.</p>

<p>Filial acknowledgements and a tribute of respect for the
father, but mother, brothers, and associates, Copeland spared
none. Without reserve—without restraint—simple and without
any object of complication, truth fell fast and spontaneously
during the short time he had to live. The philosopher, the
statesman, and the moralist—all may deduce lessons of value<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
to the future from his confessions. Reflections on his mother
show the mighty force and influence which the female parent
exercises on youth and maturity. “The rule is bad that will
not work both ways.” If in this case the mother produced
so much of evil fruit, a contrary or an opposite one must produce
contrary results—hence, the vast importance of mothers

<p>The Murrell clan first, then the Wages and Copeland next.
Both organizations came to a tragic end. Astounding as the
fact may be, there are some who prefer a life of blood and
plunder and terror, to peaceful industry and the blessings of
orderly society. If the life and history now under consideration
should fall into the hands of some of this class, let them
not indulge in the flattering unction that but for this or the
other error committed, the career of the clan might have continued
indefinitely. Let no such fatal delusions be cherished
for a moment. Under a system of semi-civilization, where
laws are only a mock farce, where amount of money is the measure
of guilt or innocence; where judges on the bench, executive
officials, rings, cliques, lawyers, demagogues, and even a
number of the clerical order—Mr. McGrath as an instance—all
operate, not according to the principles of right in consonance
with the benign influences which tend towards a rule of
natural order and justice, but in conformity with corrupt and
sordid motives for political considerations to secure wealth
and power, no matter how foul the means; under such an unhealthy
condition of circumstances, organizations like the
Murrell, the Wages and Copeland, however assiduously and
indirectly supported by men of wealth and distinction, however
bold and able the actors, cannot permanently continue.
Such combinations of lawlessness for murder and plunder, incendiarism
and all the other darker crimes which belong to
depraved natures, must terminate in death and dissolution;
but it so generally happens that the less guilty end their career
on the scaffold or in some other way by the hands of an outraged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
community; while the higher grades of participant
criminals, of larger calibre of brain, are left to revel on the
spoils for which the less fortunate have had to suffer the pains
of an ignominious death.</p>

<p>Organizations of such vast and gigantic magnitude, are incidents
of a rude and transition state of society, where population
is sparse, where means of protection are sadly at fault,
and where so many hardened criminals make their escape
through the mock forms of trials in courts, not of justice, but
of ignorance and corruption under the name of liberty and a
scrupulous tenderness in behalf of a spurious or false sentimental
color of humanity; but in proportion as population increases,
so also must detection and protection, with a better
administration of law and justice increase in the same ratio,
even if the forms of government have to be changed for the
accomplishment of the same. Wealth cannot accumulate long
without chaos and anarchy, unless protection of life and
property be commensurate.</p>

<p>But often the closing era of such terrible organizations for
bold and daring depredations on the better portions of society,
then begin other organizations of less dimensions, but more
dangerous, because more subtle and refined, and in every way
harder of detection.</p>

<p>There is something terrible, or, at least, alarming in conception
awakened by the names of <i>clans</i> and <i>bands</i>; but different
as regards <i>rings</i> and <i>cliques</i>. These last control legislation
the executives and cabinets, and nearly the whole of the judicial
rings. They are the arbiters of aspirants of every description—generally
according to the price or consideration
offered. But there is yet another lower grade of rings and
cliques, composed of subordinate officers, picayune members
of the bar, and low-down reckless strikers. When money or
other sorts of gain is to be made, these strikers are set to work,
and if they become involved in law difficulties, the cheap
lawyers, with the assistance of the officials, are always at hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
to liberate the offending culprits. Former methods of murder,
conflagration and high-handed robbery have been exchanged
for more intricate forms of conquest and gain.</p>

<p>Whoever ventures an exposure of the fashionable vices of
influential circles—whoever assails the citadels and strongholds
of crime and corruption, must not expect to elude
numerous and deep-laid conspiracies for the sacrifice of life,
which, if he escape falling a victim, he will be more than fortunate.
Even so far, the author has bitterly experienced all
this. The marvel is that he is yet alive and determined to
continue in stronger terms than before exhibited—relying on
invincible truth and the better portions of society to bear him
up through the ordeal which he has to encounter. Although
he has suffered much, and has had many “hair-breadth
escapes” from the plots and snares laid for his destruction.</p>

<p>The subsequent part of the Appendix will inform the reader
of several infernal concoctions for assassination when attempts
at intimidation failed. The first of these will embrace particulars
in the period betwixt the publication and the author’s
arrest, and the other about three years after the trial had
terminated. The period betwixt publication and arrest cannot
be devoid of interest to the reader—it is a prelude to the important
trial which followed. The incidents involved during
the time here referred to have ponderous bearings, in a circumstantial
point of view, toward establishing the substantial correctness
of Copeland’s confessions, although intended to invalidate
them and make a nullity of the whole.</p>

<p>During imprisonment Copeland seemed to fully comprehend
the profound plans and commanding power of one by the name
of Shoemake. This is the man who played so conspicuous a
part before and on trial in combination with the three prosecuting
parties of Mobile. The arch-enemy of all mankind
cannot surpass him in perfidious deception.</p>

<p>He who it was who first addressed a letter of almost matchless
duplicity to the author, while residing in Perry county, under
a forged or fictitious signature. He who it was who next
visited the author in person, first to try the arts of persuasion,
and then the designing influences of intimidation, but in either
case without the desired effect. After this, he it was who
entered into compact with the prosecuting three, of Mobile,
bore the requisition from the Governor of Alabama to the
Governor of Mississippi for the rendition of the author, and,
in the circumstances connected with the arrest, acted in such a
mysterious and suspicious manner as could leave no doubt that
he contemplated the life of the author under a plausible pretext
of resistance to lawful authority. But this object was signally
defeated. A considerable number of good citizens quickly
collected together, well armed for protection, and volunteered
to accompany the author under arrest to Mobile, which they
accordingly did, and effectually secured his safety.</p>

<p>The trial followed next. By careful attention to the circumstances
connected with it much information may be gathered,
showing the force of political considerations, and how hard the
task for truth and justice, in the first efforts, to gain a triumph
over a combination of wealth and intellect leagued together for
bad purposes. For instance, the presiding Judge, McKinstry,
could have had no personal prejudice or enmity against the
author, and in his heart might have rejoiced over the dissolution
of the clan, but his palpably reprehensible conduct on
trial furnishes convincing evidence that he was influenced by
other considerations than those of law and justice. To this
fact Dr. Bevell, one of the impaneled jurymen on the case,
had his eye turned in the references to the Judge’s conduct
and political considerations, which references will be found in
his letter published in another part of the work.</p>

<p>On the days of trial the notorious character of this said
Shoemake was made public and manifest. He was the principal
witness relied on in the prosecution. Another, equally
infamous, as demonstrated by the most satisfactory of testimony,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
by the name of Bentonville Taylor, was brought from
afar in rags and poverty, and sent back in costly attire with
money in profusion. Does the impartial judgment require
anything more to produce conviction of the shameful features
of the prosecution? If so, he will find much more before he
gets through the particulars of the trial. Added to this, the
almost universal outburst of sympathy in behalf of the author,
with letters of condolence from distant parts, all of which will
be found in the proper places of the work.</p>

<p>Under circumstances so adverse it is not to be expected that
Copeland, in his confession, could give more than a small fractional
part of the transactions of the whole clan. Since then
a number and variety of interesting matters have been collected
from the most authentic of sources, and will be found in the
appropriate place of this pamphlet.</p>

<p>The subject of crime opens an almost inexhaustible expanse
for expatiation. An elaborate treatise on its causes and remedies
is too prolix for a work of this nature—only a few passing
observations on this theme will be found interspersed, which
are relevant and have a direct bearing on the main topics
discussed.</p>

<p>And now, in closing this introductory part, the author wishes
the public to understand that he has no personal animosity
against those who so wrongfully deprived him of his liberty,
ruined him with expenses, and encompassed his life in so many
intricate ways. He has not indulged in any revengeful passions,
but has endeavored to strictly confine himself to the
unprejudiced and impartial province of the historian and biographer—according
merit where due, and with propriety denouncing
crimes, corruptions and unhealthy conspiracies whenever
they come in the way. And, if in so doing, he is to endure a
repetition of persecutions and prosecutions, with fresh dangers
added, he will try to bear them with all the fortitude he can
command, with the hope that the peaceably and honestly disposed
parts of the community will rally for the pulling down
the edifices of vice, and for establishing a better, a purer and a
healthier condition of society.</p>

<p>The number of years during which the Copeland and Wages
Gang of Land Pirates pursued a successful career of robbery,
incendiarism and murder in the United States; their final dismemberment,
disgrace and violent end at the hand of retributive
justice; and the stern moral lesson taught by their
history and fate, have induced the undersigned to publish the
confession of one of the leaders of the gang, as made by himself,
in anticipation of his death at the hands of the hangman.
Its accuracy may be relied on; and indeed it is hardly possible
to doubt the truth of its statements, so minutely, consecutively
and clearly are they related, and so consonant are they with
the various localities and the characters of the men.</p>

<p>This confession was given to me, principally by the aid of
copious memoranda which Copeland had kept for years in his
diary, and which materially refreshed his memory.</p>

<p>James Copeland, the subject of this memoir, was born near
Pascagoula river, in Jackson county, Miss., on the 18th day of
January, 1823. He was the son of Isham Copeland and
Rebecca Copeland, his wife—formerly Rebecca Wells. The
parents had resided for many years near Pascagoula river.</p>

<p>Isham Copeland was a farmer in easy circumstances, with a
good farm, several negroes, plenty of horses and mules and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
other live stock; and, in fact, he might be said to have everything
about him that a family in moderate circumstances could
require to enable him to live comfortably. He was the father
of several sons; but, alas! this, which is by most men deemed
a blessing, proved to him a curse; and after encountering many
trials in youth and manhood, just when he thought to enjoy
the peace and repose of old age, his son’s misconduct drew on
him many severe reverses of fortune, and finally drove him to
the grave broken hearted.</p>

<p>When I was about ten or eleven years of age, my father sent
me to school, and I went at intervals from time to time, to several
good teachers. I might, with proper training and management,
have received a liberal education. My father often
insisted, and urged it upon me to study and try to obtain a
good education, and he told me that he would send me to
school as long as I wished to go. But being misled by my associations
with bad company, I was engaged, instead, in studying
mischief, and other things no way profitable to myself or
advantageous to youths. It was my misfortune, that my disposition
led me on to study how to cheat, defraud and swindle
my comrades and school-mates, out of their pocket-knives,
their money or anything they might have, which I wanted, and
I was generally successful in my undertaking. If I could not
effect my object in one way, I would resort to some other, and
finally obtain it before I stopped. Indulging in this rude and
mischievous disposition, I naturally became more hardened,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
and when at school, it was my delight to see the scholars
whipped or otherwise punished, and I would often tell lies on
any of them that would displease me, so as to cause them to
get a flogging; and very often I would tell a lie on an innocent
scholar, so as to clear a favorite and guilty one, and have the
innocent one punished. It most generally happened, that I
managed my villainy so as to get clear; it sometimes happened,
however, that I got punished. This I did not care for
any longer than the punishment lasted. So soon as I was released,
I would commit a worse misdeed than the one I was
chastised for, and any of my school-mates that were the cause
of my punishment, I was certain to wreak my vengeance on,
by having them punished in some way. From my bad conduct
in school there was no teacher that would permit me to go to
his school long at a time, and whenever I had any difficulty
with my teachers, my mother would always protect and indulge
me in what I would do; and being so indulged and protected,
this excited me to commit crimes of greater magnitude. And
I am frank, here to say, that my mother has been the principal
and great cause of all my crimes and misfortunes, by stimulating
me to the commission of those deeds that have brought
me to what I am.</p>

<p>When I was about the age of twelve years, my mother one
day sent me with a sack to a neighbor’s house (Mr. Helverson’s),
to procure some vegetables or greens. I communicated
my errand to Mrs. H., who told me to go to the garden and
take what I wanted. I had no knife with me. I asked Mrs. H.
to loan me a knife, which I knew she had, and she pulled out a
very pretty little knife from her work-pocket, and told me not
to lose or break it, for it was a present made to her by a friend.
This I listened to and promised her that I would be careful.
Now, while I was in the garden procuring vegetables or greens,
my whole mind and wits were employed in devising some mode
by which I could cheat the lady out of her knife. Finally,
after I had procured my vegetables and placed them in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
sack, I put the knife in the bottom of the sack; I then returned
to the house, and told the lady that I laid the knife down in the
garden, and had forgot the place and could not find it; I asked
her to go with me and help me hunt for it, which she accordingly
did, and we both hunted diligently, but to no effect. The
lady was very anxious about her knife and much regretted its
loss, while I was all the time laughing in my sleeve, to know
how completely I had swindled her. This trick of mine passed
off very well for a time. It was, however, found out that I had
the knife, and that created some noise and trouble. I was accused
of stealing the knife. But I denied all accusations and
stated that I had bought the knife I had, in Mobile, and proved
it by my mother, who always upheld me in my rascality. This
may be said to have been my first successful feat in stealing,
although I was in the habit of stealing little frivolous things
from the school boys, before that time.</p>

<p>My father living a very close neighbor to Mr. Helverson,
whose family is related to ours, their stock run together in the
same range. My next onset in stealing was from Mr. H.
again; he had a lot of very fine fat pigs, and these were at that
time selling at a high price in Mobile. My brother Isham
(nicknamed Whinn) and myself geared up a horse in a cart
and started, pretendingly for a camp hunt to kill deer and haul
to Mobile. We went a short distance that night and camped.
During the night we went to Helverson’s hog bed, and stole a
cart load of his finest pigs, fifteen in number, hauled them to
Mobile and sold them at two dollars each. Although Mr. H.
was satisfied in his own mind that we had stolen his pigs, yet
he could not prove it; and I escaped again. So I was stimulated
with my success, and being still more encouraged and
upheld by my mother, and not exceeding fourteen years of age,
I believed that I could make an independent fortune by thieving,
and became insensible of the danger which awaited me.
A short time after the incident just related had transpired, I
made a second rake upon Mr. H.’s pigs. But in my second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
adventure, I was not so fortunate as I was in the first, for Mr.
H. <em>rather got me</em> that time. The proof was sufficiently
strong, and I was prosecuted, for the first time, for pig stealing.
Well knowing my guilt as I did, and the evidence against
me, I thought my case extremely doubtful. I was arrested by
the sheriff of Jackson county, and had to give bond to appear
at the Circuit Court of Jackson county, to answer an indictment
preferred against me by the State of Mississippi, for the
crime of larceny. The bond required me to attend the Court
from term to term, and from day to day, until discharged by
due course of law. My poor old father employed the best
counsel to defend me, that could be obtained in all the country.
This cost the poor old man a large sum of money. My counsel,
after learning the facts of the case, advised me that my only
chance of acquittal, was to put off the trial as long as possible.
This he did from term to term, in hopes that something might
occur to get me acquitted. I well knew if my case should be
brought to a hearing, I would be convicted, and I dreaded the
consequences; for I knew that there would then be no chance
on earth to prevent my being sent to the penitentiary.</p>

<p>Fully sensible of my situation, young as I was at that time,
it became necessary for me to devise some plan to get out of
the scrape, and I reflected for weeks how to manage this matter.
One day, in a conversation with my mother and some
other confidential friends, she and they advised me to consult
<span class="smcap">Gale H. Wages</span>; and my mother said she would send for
Wages and see him herself, as he was a particular friend of
hers. This she accordingly did, and he came to our house.
There were several of the clan at our house then, though I did
not know them at that time as such; but my mother did, as I
afterward found out when I joined them. Among the many
plans proposed by the clan, none seemed to suit my mother or
Wages. Some were for waylaying and killing the witnesses;
some for one thing, and some for another. Finally Wages
made his proposition, which was seconded by my mother. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
was the proposition I had been waiting to hear, for my mother
told me that whatever plan Wages would pursue, he would be
certain to get me clear. His plan was, that we should, in
some way or other, endeavor to have the Court house and all
the records destroyed, and so destroy the indictment against
me. By that means there would be nothing against me, and
I should be acquitted, as no charge would rest against me.</p>

<p>With this plan I was highly pleased, and much elated with
the idea that I had a friend fully able and competent to bear
me out, and who would stand up to me at any and all hazards,
and bring me out clear. Wages pledged himself to me in private
to do this, and he was as good as his word. We set a
time for the accomplishment of our design, and we accordingly
met. The precise date I cannot recollect, but it was a
dry time, and a dark night, with a strong breeze from the
North. After procuring sufficient dry combustibles, we entered
the Court-house, went up stairs, and placed our combustibles
in the roof, on the windward side of the house. Wages
went down stairs to patrol around. After reconnoitering
around sufficiently, he gave me the signal, by a rap or knock
on the wall; I immediately sprung open the door of my dark-lantern,
applied the match, and made my escape down stairs,
and Wages and myself left the place in double quick time.
We halted on an eminence some five or six hundred yards to
the southeast of the Court house, to watch the conflagration.
Such a sight I never had before beheld. The flames seemed
to ascend as high, if not higher than the tops of the tallest
pine trees; they made everything perfectly light for over two
hundred yards around. After the Court-house, records and all
were completely consumed, and the flames had abated and
died away, we took our departure for home, rejoicing at our
success in the accomplishment of our design. There was a
great deal of talk and conjecture about the burning of the
Court-house, and we were accused—at least, I was strongly
censured, but there never was any discovery made, nor any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
proof sufficient to get hold of either Wages or myself; so I
again got clear of a crime of which I was guilty and for which
I ought to have been punished.</p>

<p>The assistance, advice and protection I had received from
Wages, gave me the utmost confidence in him, and he had unbounded
influence over me; I looked on him as my warmest
and most confidential friend, and I eventually pinned my whole
faith on him and relied upon him for advice and directions in
everything. Although a villain, as I must now acknowledge
Wages was, yet he had some redeeming traits in his character.
At his own home he was friendly, kind and hospitable; in
company, he was affable and polite; and no person at first acquaintance,
would have believed for one moment, that he was
the <em>out lawed brigand</em> that he finally proved himself to be;
and I firmly believe he would have spilt the last drop of blood
in his veins to protect me; yet I must say that he was the
principal author of my misfortunes, and has brought me where
I am.</p>

<p>After the burning of the Court House, the intercourse between
Wages and myself became more frequent. We became
strongly allied to each other, and confidence was fully established
between us. Wages one day made a proposition to me; to
join him, and go with him, alleging that we could make money
without work, and live in ease and genteel style; that there
were a great many persons concerned with him, in different
parts of the country, some of them men of wealth and in good
standing in the community in which they lived; that they had
an organized <em>Band</em> that would stand up to each other at all
hazard; that they had a <i>Wigwam</i> in the city of Mobile, where
they held occasional meetings; and that they had many confederates
there whom the public little suspected. To this proposition
I readily acceded; it corresponded with my disposition
and idea of things, and then, being the age I was, and stimulated
by my past success, I feared nothing.</p>

<p>I went to Mobile with Wages, and there he introduced me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
some of his comrades, who were members of his Clan. They
accordingly held a meeting at their <i>Wig-wam</i>, and I was there
introduced by Wages, (who was their president,) as a candidate
for membership, I should have been rejected, had Wages
not interceded for me. I was finally passed and admitted to
membership. Wages then administered to me the oath, which
every member had to take. I was then instructed and given
the signs and pass-words of the Clan; and above all was cautioned
to keep a watchful eye, and not to let any person entrap
me; nor let any person, under pretence of belonging to the
Clan, or wishing to join, obtain in any way information from
me in relation to the existence of the Clan, or their plan or
mode of operation. The oath was administered on the Holy
Bible. (Oh! what a profanation of that good book!) The
form of the oath was: “You solemnly swear upon the Holy
Evangelist of Almighty God, that you will never divulge, and
always conceal and never reveal any of the signs or pass-words
of our order; that you will not invent any sign, token or device
by which the secret mysteries of our order may be made
known; that you will not in any way betray or cause to be betrayed
any member of this order—the whole under pain of
having your head severed from your body—so help you God.”</p>

<p>Wages was President and Chief of the Clan. All important
business of the Clan was entrusted to his care. He called
meetings, gave all notices to the Clan for their gatherings, and
when assembled he presided in the chair. In all matters, he
had the preferred right to introduce resolutions for the benefit
of the Clan.</p>

<p>There were present at this meeting, Charles McGrath, Vice-President;
McClain, Secretary; John Eelva, Henry Sanford,
Richard Cabel and Sampson Teapark, Vigilant Committee;
William Brown, of Mobile, Tyler.</p>

<p>After I was thus initiated, and invested with all the signs,
words and tokens, and fully instructed in the mysteries of the
Clan, I was taught their mode of secret correspondence, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
means of an alphabet or key, invented by the notorious Murrell,
of Tennessee. I was furnished with the alphabet and
key, and in that same mystic writing I was furnished with a
list of all the names that belonged to our Clan, and a list of
several other Clans, that ours was in correspondence with,
their several places of residence, and the locations of their
Wig-wams; so that when we stole a horse, a mule, or a negro,
we knew precisely where to carry them, to have them concealed
and sold.</p>

<p>After I had been thus fully initiated and had become identified
with the Clan, Wages and McGrath, knowing my ability,
and that I was a keen shrewd and cunning lad, took me under
their immediate special charge. We had a rendezvous at old
Wages’ about twelve miles from Mobile, and another at Dog
River, about the same distance in a different direction. We
ranged that season from one place to the other, and sometimes
in town, stealing any and everything we could. Sometimes
killing beef, hogs and sheep, hauling them to town and selling
them; sometimes stealing a fine horse or mule and conveying
it to some of our comrades to conceal; and occasionally a negro
would disappear. All this while, we pretended to be engaged
in making shingles, burning charcoal, and getting laths
and pickets, each for himself. We always managed to furnish
the family with all the meat they could use.</p>

<p>We worked on in this way until late in the summer or early
in the fall of 1839, when most of the inhabitants had left the
city; and we having six of our Clan then employed as City
Guards, we rallied our forces and Wages ordered a meeting.
It was there resolved that we should prepare ourselves with
boats and teams—the boats to be stationed at a particular
wharf in Mobile, on a certain night, and the teams at a landing
named, on Dog River the next night. It was also ordered
that we should assemble at our Wig-wam on the first night at
seven o’clock. The meeting then adjourned.</p>

<p>The promised evening came, and every member was punctual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
in his attendance. It was a full meeting of the Clan. We
all rigged ourselves out with false moustaches, some with false
whiskers, some with a green patch over one eye, and many of
them dressed like sailors, and thus fitted out and disguised,
we were ready for action, with all kinds of false keys, skeleton
keys, lock picks, crow bars, &amp;c. At nine o’clock the City
Guards turned out, and by a previous arrangement, those of
our comrades who mounted guard, were on the first watch.
They immediately sent two of their number to inform us where
to make the first break. They had reconnoitered previously
and knew what places had the richest and most valuable goods,
and they had also procured false keys for several stores. Thus
armed, each man with his revolver, bowie knife and dark lantern,
about ten o’clock we started out. Our first break was
a fancy dry-goods store which we opened with one of our keys.
We took over $5,000 worth of goods from that store, fine silks,
muslins, &amp;c. We next entered a rich jewelry store, and made
a clean sweep there. There were no fine watches; we got
some silver watches and two or three gold watches, left, we
supposed, to be repaired. Our raise there was about four to
five thousand dollars. Our next break was on a large clothing
store. There we took $3000 worth of the finest and best
clothing. While we were at this, some of the clan were packing
off and storing in their boats. We had procured two butcher
carts, which would stand a short distance off and our men
packed and loaded the carts, which they hauled to our boats.
About half-past eleven o’clock, knowing that there would be a
new guard out at twelve o’clock, we dispersed and set fire to
each of the stores we had robbed. Soon there was the cry of
fire; the wind commenced blowing, and the fire spread rapidly.
Our Clan now commenced operations anew; we seized and
carried out goods from any and every store we came to, still
retaining the carts. We kept them constantly employed; and
before daylight we had loaded two large, swift boats, and had
a large quantity of merchandise in a “wood flat.” A little before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
daylight, we left with our boats for Dog River. We arrived
there about eight o’clock, ten miles from the city, and
went up the river to our landing place, where we secreted our
goods until that night, when we had our teams at work, hauling
off and concealing goods, which we finally accomplished
the second night. Wages then ordered a meeting of the clan,
and punctual attendance was required. The object of this
meeting was for a report from each member of the amount of
goods he had obtained, so that an equal distribution might be
made. From the report then made, we had procured over
twenty-five thousand dollars worth of goods of almost every
description. We had an abundant supply of groceries and
liquors. Our friends in the city had a bountiful supply of
almost everything. We made a division of our plunder, and
Wages, McGrath and myself got for our share about six thousand
dollars worth. We were permitted to select the finest
and most costly goods, such as the jewelry, fine silks, muslins
etc., which we could carry in our trunks.</p>

<p>Having properly stowed away our effects, we took a trip
from Mobile to Florida by way of Pensacola, carrying with us
some of the jewelry, watches and dry goods. We traveled
from Pensacola through Florida, with our pack of goods, as
pedlars, each taking a different route, and all to meet at Apalachicola
on a certain day. Wages went the middle route,
McGrath the southern route, and I went the northern route.
I traveled some distance, occasionally selling some of my
plunder. I eventually arrived at a very rich neighborhood,
near the Chatochooca river, not far from the Alabama line.
There I soon disposed of most of my goods.</p>

<p>I fell in with a house where a very rich old widow lady lived.
She bought a good deal of my jewelry and other goods for her
two young daughters. I pretended to be sick, for an excuse
to stay there. This lady had a very nice mulatto girl about
seventeen years old. During the time I was there pretending
to be sick, I made an arrangement with this girl to run away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
with me; I promised to take her for a wife, and carry her to a
free State. She was to meet me on a certain night at the
landing on the river, about one mile from that place. I left
the house pretending to go to Columbus, Ga., and traveled up
the river some thirty miles, where I stole a canoe. I procured
some meat and bread and started down the river. On the
night appointed I was at the landing, and about ten o’clock
the mulatto girl came. She had provided bed clothing and
provisions in plenty. I then started down the river with my
girl. We went about thirty miles that night, and lay by in
the river swamp all next day. The next night we made about
fifty miles down the river. The third night we reached Apalachicola,
two days previous to the time appointed to meet
Wages and McGrath. I landed a short distance above town,
and left my girl in a swamp just after daylight, and then went
to the city. In looking around I fell in with John Harden, he
being one of our clan. He soon gave me an introduction to a
place where I could conceal my girl, and stay myself. The
next day McGrath arrived; I met him in the street, and gave
him a sign to follow me to our rendezvous. I showed him my
girl and told him the way I had got her; he then told me that
he had stolen a likely negro fellow, and had him concealed in
a swamp about four miles from town. After dinner, and a
little before night, McGrath and I went out to the swamp,
brought in his fellow, and concealed him at the same place
where my girl was.</p>

<p>The next day about eight o’clock Wages came up; we were
all on the lookout for him. We gave him a hint to come to
our place. We showed Wages what a raise we had made; he
then told us that he had stolen two negroes and two fine
horses, and that they were concealed in the swamp about five
miles from town. In fear of pursuit he said we must leave
instanter. We made an arrangement with Harden and our
landlord to take the horses. They gave Wages twenty-five
dollars a piece for the horses, and our board bill. That night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
Wages and Harden went out to the swamp; Harden took the
horses and left, and Wages brought in his negroes and placed
them with ours. That night while Wages was gone after his
negroes McGrath and I went to a coffee house, and while there
we met some Spaniards that had a little schooner there, and
which was then loaded for New Orleans. We made the arrangement
with them to carry us and our negroes to New Orleans,
returned to our place, and had everything prepared. About
ten o’clock Wages came in with his negroes, and we all went
on board the vessel, which weighed anchor and sailed down the
bar. Next morning the captain cleared his vessel, and by ten
o’clock we were over the bar and under way, with a good breeze.
On the second night, a little before day, we landed at the
Pontchartrain railroad, and left in the first cars for the city.
We went into one of our places in the city, got breakfast for
ourselves and negroes, and at nine o’clock we left in a steamboat
for Bayou Sara. We landed there, crossed the river and
went to one of our clan—a rich planter—where we sold our
negroes. I got one thousand dollars for my mulatto girl;
McGrath sold his fellow for eleven hundred dollars, and Wages
sold each of his boys for nine hundred dollars. We took our
money and left for Mobile. My girl made considerable fuss
when I was about to leave, but I told her I would return in a
month, and rather pacified her. I must here acknowledge that
my conscience did that time feel mortified, after the girl had
come with me, and I had lived with her as a wife, and she had
such implicit confidence in me. My conscience still feels
mortified when I reflect how much better it would have been
for me to have kept her and lived with her than to come to
what I have.</p>

<p>On our way to Mobile we stopped in New Orleans three or
four days. During our stay there was one fire. We made a
small raise on that of about one hundred dollars each. McGrath
came very near being caught by attempting to make a second
haul. We left next day for Mobile; landed at Pascagoula, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
walked home by land, with our money and the small amount
of goods we had stolen in New Orleans.</p>

<p>We then deposited our money, and gathered all the balance
of our fine goods that we had stolen in Mobile at the great
fire, and what we had stolen in New Orleans, and prepared ourselves
for a second tour. We had realized about four thousand
five hundred dollars, which we hid in the ground, and we took
each of us about one hundred and fifty dollars for our expenses,
and an equal share of the goods.</p>

<p>On the 25th day of March, 1843, Wages, McGrath and
myself left Mobile bound to Texas; we went to New Orleans,
where we landed the next day. We remained there about three
days and sold a great quantity of our goods, such as were too
heavy to carry. While we were in the city Wages won about
seven hundred dollars from a Tennessee corn dealer by the
name of Murphy. McGrath and myself had lost about one
hundred and fifty dollars each. We left New Orleans, went up
the Mississippi, and landed at the house of an old friend that
belonged to our clan. His name was Welter. We spent one
day and night with him; we had seen him in the city a few
days before, and were invited to call, but when we approached
his residence we all pretended to be entire strangers. This
was a strict injunction upon our clan—when traveling never to
meet any of our comrades as acquaintances, but always treat
them as entire strangers, that we had never seen in our life.</p>

<p>Wages pretended to have some business with the old gentleman,
and introduced himself, McGrath and myself under fictitious
names. The old gentleman had two very nice genteel
daughters. They were sociable and refined, well educated, and
highly accomplished every way; he was wealthy, and had a
good reputation in his neighborhood, and no one would for
one moment have suspected him of belonging to our clan. But
I afterward learned from Wages that this old gentleman had
belonged to the Murrell Clan for many years; and that was
what carried Wages there, to get some information relative to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
some negroes that had been stolen and carried to Louisiana
near the Texas line. Wages also informed me that this same
man made all his property by stealing and kidnapping negroes
from Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois.
Having obtained the information we wanted, we made preparation
to leave. We offered to pay our fare, but this was
promptly refused. We were well entertained; the old gentleman
furnished us each with a flask of good brandy, and, after
thanking him and his family for their kind, hospitable treatment,
we bid adieu, and took our departure for Texas.</p>

<p>We got on a steamboat and went up the Mississippi to the
mouth of Red river, and up that river to a landing called the
New Springs. There we paid our passage and went on shore,
each with his pack and his double-barrel gun. We stopped at
a house about one mile from the river, where we called for our
dinner, which we got, and we all remained there until next day,
during which time we sold a considerable amount of our goods
at that house and in the neighborhood, which made our packs
much lighter. We left next day, stopping at all houses, and
selling our goods, which we did at a rapid rate, as we had
stolen them and were not sufficient judges of their value to
know what price to ask, and in consequence we often sold them
at one-half their value, and so soon got rid of them.</p>

<p>Having disposed of the principal part of our goods, about
the fourth day after we left the New Spring landing, we were
approaching the prairie county on the Texas border. We provided
ourselves with bread and salt; we had ammunition. Shortly
before night, we came to a small piece of woodland, by a
ravine. There was a large drove of cattle of all sizes there;
McGrath shot a very fat two-year old heifer; we skinned the
hind quarters and tenderloin; we built up a fire, salted some of
our meat and roasted it by the fire and feasted sumptuously.
The wolves came near our camp and made a dreadful noise, but
at daybreak we shot and killed three and the balance ran off.
They had devoured all the heifer’s meat, but we had provided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
sufficient for our journey that day. We set out and traveled
in a direction to find a settlement, then made about twenty-five
miles south of Shreveport. That was the place where Welter
had told Wages that the negroes were, that we were after. We
traveled about thirty miles that day, and suffered very much
for water. We reached a settlement a little before night, on
some of the waters of the Sabine River. It was the residence
of some stock keepers; there were some three or four families,
and some fifteen or twenty Mexican drovers, and horse thieves;
they had just been to Natchitoches, and had a full supply of
rum; a few of them could speak English. We quartered with
them, and that night we opened the little remnant of our goods
and jewelry, and had a general raffle. By the next day we had
realized from our raffle, sufficient to purchase each of us a good
Spanish saddle and bridle, and a good Texas horse. We learned
from one of these Mexicans the residence of the man who
owned the negroes that we were after, and we also learned that
he and his family were strict members of the Methodist Church.
Now it was that one of us had to turn preacher, so as to reconnoiter
around the place. Wages and I put that on McGrath.
We all mounted our horses and started, having procured plenty
of lassoes, &amp;c., McGrath being an Irishman and his tongue
tipped with plenty of blarney.</p>

<p>We traveled for two days very moderately, and, our chief employment
was drilling McGrath, how to pray and sing, and
give that long Methodist groan, and “Amen.” He having
made considerable progress, we went to Natchitoches. McGrath
entered that town by one road, and Wages and myself by another.
McGrath went among a few of his brethren that
evening.</p>

<p>To our astonishment it was posted at every corner, that the
“Rev. Mr. McGrath, from Charleston, South Carolina, would
preach at the Methodist Church that evening, at half-past
seven.” We attended church. McGrath took his stand in the
pulpit. He made a very genteel apology to his audience, saying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
he was much fatigued from his travel; that he had caught
cold and was very hoarse and could not sing; but he read out
the hymn. It was: “Hark from the tombs a doleful sound.”
One old brother pitched the tune to Old Hundred, and they all
chimed in, Wages and myself among the rest; Wages sang bass
and I tenor, and we all made that old church sound like distant
thunder. After singing, McGrath made a very good but short
prayer; he then took his text in the 16th chapter of St. Mark,
at the verse where Mary the mother, and Mary Magdalene
found the stone rolled from the door of the sepulchre. “And
he said unto them, Be not affrighted; ye seek Jesus of Nazareth,
who was crucified; he has risen; he is not here; behold the
place where they laid him.” He read several verses in that
chapter, and then made some very good explanations relative
to the parables, and prophesies on the coming of the Messiah,
and the mysterious way in which he disappeared, and wound
up his discourse by telling the audience that he had been a
great sinner in his young days, that it had been but a few
years since the Lord had called him to preach, and he thanked
his God that he was now able and willing to lay down his life
upon the altar of God; he then raved, and exhorted all to repent
and turn to God; and after raving about half an hour
called all his hearers that wished to be prayed for to come
forward. The whole congregation kneeled down; he prayed
for them all, and finally finished, sang another hymn and dismissed
his congregation, and we all retired, Wages and myself
to a gaming table, and McGrath with some of his brethren.
Next day the members of the church there waited on McGrath
to know what was his pecuniary situation. He told them that
he was very poor, was on his way to see a rich relation of his,
about two hundred miles from there; that he carried his gun
to keep off wild beasts, etc. They made up money to buy him
a fine suit of black, a new saddle and saddle-bags and fifty
dollars in cash. We remained there two days, when McGrath
left. Wages and I left by another road. We all met a short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
distance from town and made the proper arrangement for our
operations. McGrath was to go on to the house of this man
that had the negroes, and there make what discoveries were
necessary. He was to join Wages and myself at San Antonio
on the first day of September following. Wages and I left in
the direction for the Red Land on the Irish bayou.</p>


<h3 id="POISONING_THE_OVERSEER">POISONING THE OVERSEER.</h3>

<p>A few days after we passed the residence of an old bachelor
who had a large number of negroes; he was absent at Natchitoches
and had left his overseer in charge. We stopped there,
and remained two days; we procured some whisky from a
grocery store a short distance off; prepared some of it with
<em>poison</em>, and induced the overseer to drink freely. We gave
him a full dose of the poison, and before day on the third
morning he was dead.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Wages and I had made arrangements to steal a
likely negro woman and two young negroes, a boy and girl,
about ten years of age, besides two of the finest horses on the
place. We sent out runners to let one or two of the neighbors
know that the overseer was dead; we had our negroes and
horses concealed about five miles distant, and about sunrise we
offered to pay our bills and left, pretending to go to New
Orleans. After we had got out of sight of the plantation we
made a circuit and went to the place where the negroes and
horses were concealed. Having provided ourselves with provisions,
we remained secreted at that place all that day. That
night we started with our negroes and horses. Wages took
the lead; our horses and negroes were all refreshed. We
traveled a brisk gait all that night and till next day at nine or
ten o’clock. We suffered greatly for water, having met with
none after midnight, until we stopped at a small creek. We
had passed no houses after daylight. After we stopped we
stripped our horses, gave them water and hampered them to
graze; we got water for ourselves and negroes, and took a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
little spirits we had, and eat the balance of our provisions.
After we had rested a little while, Wages took his gun and
went up the creek in search of game; I took mine and went to
the road we had just left, and went on rather down the creek.
At the distance of about two miles I came to a plantation. It
was an old stock place, inhabited by some of the old creole
settlers that had lived there in Spanish times. I inquired the
distances and courses of the country. They told me it was
about forty miles to the first river, and that there was but one
settlement on the road where we could get water for ourselves
and horses, at about twenty-five miles. After I had got this
information I purchased some bread and potatoes and a small
piece of dried beef, and returned to our camp. Wages had
killed a fine deer, and he and the negro woman were roasting a
fine piece. We fared well that day. That night about dark
we left our camp, provided with provisions for two days. A
little after midnight we reached the first water. A little before
daylight we reached some settlements and woodland; we
traveled a short distance and came to a small, deep river. We
there found a ferry flat and some small boats. We took the
flat and carried our horses and negroes over; took the flat
back, and took a small boat, and Wages and I crossed to our
horses and negroes. By this time we could discern the appearance
of day. We mounted and traveled on; we could perceive
we were passing several large plantations; by sunrise we
had traveled four or five miles. We could see at a distance
several clusters of woodland in the prairies. We made for one
of them some distance from the road, which we found afforded
sufficient shelter for that day. We found some water, but not
plenty, and very bad; our horses would drink but little of it.
We stripped and hampered our horses to graze, took our
breakfast and told the negroes to go to sleep. I went to sleep,
and Wages kept watch. About twelve o’clock I was awakened
by the report of a gun. I rose up and found that Wages had
shot a fat yearling beef. We skinned and saved the hind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
quarters and loin, and salted it a little and barbecued it. While
Wages lay down and took a nap the negro woman and I attended
to the meat. About an hour before sunset Wages
awoke, and we all eat heartily. We eat the last of our bread
and potatoes; our horses had finished grazing and were resting,
and about sunset we began to pack up for traveling, with
plenty of meat and no bread. About dark we left our sheltered
woods and started on the road again. We were then about
one hundred and twenty miles from the place where we had
stolen the negroes. We traveled on that night about thirty
miles, and reached a large creek between midnight and day.
We passed one or two plantations, and very little woodland.
When Wages came to the creek he examined the ford and
found horse tracks; he rode in first, went over and came back,
and took the bridle of the horse that had the two little negroes
and led him safely across, and the negro woman and myself
followed. We went on some seven or eight miles, and came to
woodland and plantations again. Some of the plantations were
very large. We continued traveling till daylight; after day we
passed several fine, large plantations. The sun was about one
hour high when we came to a ferry on a large river. We called,
and the ferryman was a negro; we inquired the distance from
the last river we had crossed; he said sixty-three miles. The
negro was a very intelligent fellow; we inquired particularly
for San Antonio, and told him there was where we were going.
We inquired for several other places, and left; at a short distance
we found a place where we could rest, not far from a
plantation. There Wages and myself procured some corn for
our horses, the first they had eaten for several days. We also
procured some bread; after we had fed and rested our horses
and slept some ourselves, a little before night we started again.
We traveled that night about thirty-five miles, and stopped at a
small creek and camped till daylight. We then started, crossed
the creek, went out a short distance and turned our course
more to the east. We took a trail that led us down the creek.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
We halted about noon to rest our horses, which by this time
were much fatigued. Here we procured something for ourselves
to eat.</p>

<p>We were now over two hundred miles from the place where
we had stolen the negroes; we here enquired for several places
and where was the best place to locate. We wanted to find
a rich neighborhood where there was good society, etc. We
got directions for several places, among the rest the lower
settlement on the Brasos river. After we had rested, late in
the afternoon, we set out, pretending to be bound for San
Antonio, but we steered our course for the Brasos river, where
we arrived the second day after. We quartered our negroes
with a planter there and traveled around. We at length found
a purchaser, some twenty miles from the place where the negroes
were. We delivered them to him and received the pay for
them—sixteen hundred dollars. We took the horses about
forty miles and sold one, and about thirty miles further we
sold the other. We then went some distance and sold our own
horses.</p>

<p>We had realized from all our sales a little short of two
thousand dollars. This was about the tenth of May. The
money was principally in New Orleans Bank bills, and we had
some gold and silver to pay our little expenses. We now
steered our course for San Antonio, on foot, and reached there
in about five days. We traveled leisurely, and procured some
two-headed Texas gourds to carry our water through the
prairies. After resting a day or two, we looked around to see
how the land lay. We went into a store and bought two light
Spanish saddles, with bridles and all the apparatus for riding.
We put them up in a genteel package, and provided ourselves
with provisions for two days. Each shouldered his pack, and
we left San Antonio in the night, and steered our course west.
We had traveled some ten or fifteen miles, when we stopped
at a small creek and camped. Next morning we traveled on
some twenty-five miles farther, when we came to a ranche,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
where there was a great stock of horses, mules, jacks, jennies
and horned cattle. We hid our saddles before we approached
the place, and went up with our bundles of clothes and guns
and asked for something to eat, which was given us—plenty
milk and bread. Only one or two of the people could speak
English, and that very indifferently. An old man, the head
of the place, and his drover and herdsman, spoke the best
English. We asked the old man to let us have a couple of
horses and saddles, and we would go with him a hunting and
take our guns; we told him we wished to see the country; he
told us “yes,” and furnished us with horses. We spent a week
or more with him. We killed plenty of venison to supply the
whole ranche.</p>


<h3 id="MURDER_OF_THE_TWO_MEXICANS">MURDER OF THE TWO MEXICANS IN TEXAS.</h3>

<p>One day Wages told him that we wanted to go and camp out
that night about twenty-five miles off; we would be back next
night, and wanted one of his gentle mules to pack; he told us
to take the mule and any horses we pleased, and helped us to
pack up, with water, provisions and whatever we wanted. We
started and remained out that night and the next, and returned
the third day. We had seven fine deer in all; he asked what
kept us so long—had we been lost? We told him we had, and
that while we were out we had met with an acquaintance of
ours, buying horses and mules, and that he had furnished us
money to buy thirty good horses and thirty mules, if we could
get them delivered at a certain place named, about one hundred
miles from there. We showed him the gold we had, and
satisfied him as to the money, which was to be paid on delivery
of the horses and mules at the place mentioned. The horses
and mules were selected, and the price agreed upon. Gentle
lead and pack mules were selected, and every preparation was
made for our departure. We were to go with him and return
with him, so as to see that the contract was complied with.
The day arrived and we set out with five mules packed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
five gentle lead mules, with bells on, and a young half-breed
Indian to assist in driving, and all of us mounted on the best
of horses. We had managed to procure our new saddles and
put them in their packs, on a mule that was set apart for us.
Thus equipped, with plenty of water and provisions, we set
out a little after daylight. Our travel that day was upwards of
thirty miles, on account of having water. The next day was
farther. We however made the two points. The next day
our only stopping place was about twenty miles, and the next
was thirty miles.</p>

<p>This twenty-mile place appeared to be a dead lake or spring,
with an underground discharge, with a few small groves of
timber near by, and several lakes or sinks in the ground, in the
direction the water was supposed to run under ground. We
left our second night’s camp on the third morning, and arrived
at the twenty-mile place in the forenoon. We, as usual,
stripped and hampered our horses to graze, eat dinner, and
the old Mexican and his man lay down to sleep. Wages and
I took our guns and went off, pretending to hunt. We killed
a turkey and a prairie hen and a small deer. We cleaned our
guns, wiped them out, loaded them with the largest buck-shot,
took our game and went to the camp. While loading our guns,
we made the arrangement in what way to dispatch our traveling
companions, for that was the way we intended to pay for
the horses and mules. So it was agreed that the next morning,
before day, we were to prepare some dry grass and have
our guns ready; Wages was to get up, wake me, and we were
to set the straw on fire, to make a light to see the position in
which the two men lay.</p>

<p>All that night I did not sleep one minute of sound sleep.
The most awful and frightful dreams infested my mind all
night, and Wages told me the next day that his sleep was disturbed
in the same way, and he then regretted the act and
wished he had not done it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>Wages rose in the morning and easily waked me, for I was
not in a sound sleep. We took our guns; I crawled close to
where the young man lay, and got my gun ready. Wages was
to fire first. He put his light against a small brush, and the
old man partly waked and turned his face toward Wages, who
fired the contents of one barrel in the old man’s forehead.</p>

<p>The young man was lying with his back to me; I placed the
muzzle of my gun to the back of his head, where the neck
joined it. My finger was on the trigger. At the report of
Wages’ gun, I pulled the trigger, and there was but little distinction
in the report of the two guns.</p>

<p>Both men gave a suppressed, struggling scream, and expired.</p>

<p>Our next work was to dispose of them, which we did by
slinging them with ropes, swinging them on a pole, carrying
them to one of the sink holes close to the camp, and burying
them there. We deposited with them all the clothes that had
any blood on them; and with the hatchet they had, we sharpened
a short pole and partially covered them with dirt. We next
went to the camp and raked out with sticks and brush all the
signs of blood, and took brush and dry leaves and built fires on
the ground where we had killed them. All of this we had accomplished
by a little before sunrise.</p>

<p>Our next work was to prepare to leave the place. We took
the old man’s fine massive silver spurs, his silver stirrups and
silver bridle bits, his gold rings, sleeve buttons, etc. We took
our new saddle and bridles, and concealed all the old ones in
the prairie, about five miles from the camp. After we had arranged
everything to our liking, we gathered our pack mules
and packed them; herded up the lead mule and the drove;
Wages mounted the old man’s horse, and I the young man’s,
we tied our other two horses together and turned them in the
drove, and all things being now completed, we set out about
eight o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>We now had the sixty horses and mules and the ten lead and
pack mules, the two fine horses of the old man and his servant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
and the two horses he had loaned us to ride, which made
seventy-four head in all, and a better selected drove of horses
never left Texas. We pursued our journey that day very silent.
Wages had but little to say and I had less. We had in our
hurry and confusion forgotten to supply ourselves with water,
and had but little victuals to eat that were cooked. About a
quart of water in our gourds, was all we had for the day. We
came to the water late in the evening. We suffered very much
for water that day, as did our horses. We stripped and hampered
them to graze, after they had got water, and then prepared
some thing for ourselves. We had our turkey and part
of the deer; we built a fire and barbecued the game. After
we had eat, Wages said he could not sleep, and told me to lie
down and take a nap.</p>

<p>I laid down, but could not sleep. Every time I would fall into
a doze, the vision of the young man I had killed the night
before, would appear before my eyes, and I would start up in a
fright. After several ineffectual attempts, I finally got up, and
told Wages I could not sleep, and told him to try it. He laid
down and was quite still for some time. All at once he screamed
out “Oh! my God!” and jumped upon his feet. I called and
asked what was the matter, and he declared that he saw the old
man he had killed, standing over him, and that he plainly saw
the shot holes in his head, and the blood running down his
face. So we both set up the balance of the night.</p>

<p>The next morning we started very early. About noon we
came to a large creek where we procured plenty of water for
ourselves and the drove; we halted and rested awhile, and then
pursued our journey with little delay, making the route as direct
as possible for the mouth of Red River. We did not pass
the settlement on Irish Bayou, nor Natchitoches. We arrived
at the mouth of Red River and went down the river until we
came opposite Bayou Sara, where we had our horses and mules
ferried over.</p>

<p>We went to a man living out from the river, and effected a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
sale of all the horses, except the four saddle horses. We went
up into Wilkinson County, Mississippi, where we sold all the
mules, getting fifty dollars for each of the horses and an average
of seventy-five dollars for each of the mules. We sold the
two saddle horses that Wages and myself rode before we killed
the two Mexicans, for one hundred dollars each. We then
shaped our course for Natchez, and when within about twenty
miles of it, we effected sale of the two horses we were riding,
to one man; he gave Wages one hundred and fifty dollars for
the horse the old Mexican had, and he gave me one hundred
and twenty-five dollars for the one I rode, and sent us in a
carriage to Natchez, where we arrived about the last of June.
We had realized on our trip that time about six thousand six
hundred and seventy-five dollars.</p>

<p>We had not been in Natchez long before a steamboat passed
down and we went on board. We had preserved our saddles,
bridles and all our traveling equipage. We landed at New
Orleans, went to the bank and deposited all our money, but a
few hundred dollars, which we retained in gold coin—two and
a half and five dollar pieces. We remained in New Orleans to
spend the fourth of July with our associates there.</p>

<p>On the 5th of July, 1841, Wages and I left New Orleans
and embarked on a small steamboat bound to Shreveport on
Red River, taking with us our saddles, bridles and traveling
equipage. In consequence of very dry weather Red River
was very low. We had some delay in getting to Shreveport.
We, however, reached there, and found some wagons traveling
out to the interior of Texas. We made arrangements with
them to haul our baggage, and we traveled with them part of
the time, some times before them and some times behind. We
kept with us our bridles and ropes or lassoes. About the
fourth day after we left Shreveport, we started on before the
wagons, and traveled some fifteen to twenty miles. By noon
we came to a settlement on the border of a small river, one
branch of the Trinity, we supposed, and there rested and eat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
some bread and meat. In the evening we reconnoitered and
discovered in the vicinity a large, newly settled plantation, a
good number of horses and mules grazing around, and a large
number of negroes about the place. Wages sent me to watch
on the main road for the wagons, while he watched the horses
and mules. About sunset a negro came to drive the horses
and mules to their lot. Wages asked what his master’s name
was and what State he moved from. He told Wages his master’s
name was Smith; and he moved from South Carolina.
Wages asked if he was a good master. The negro said no;
that he did not feed well nor clothe well, and that he drove
hard and whipped hard. Wages then told the negro, if he
would come down that night to the ferry, which was about
two miles off, he would give him a shirt and pantaloons and a
dram. Wages then came to where I was stationed on the
road, but the wagons had passed about one hour before. We
hurried on and got to the ferry a little after dark. The wagons
had just got over and were camped on the other bank. We
called, and the ferryman let us over, and went to his house
some distance off. We took supper with the wagons. After
supper, Wages and I feigned an excuse to cross the river to
bathe. We took with us a flask of whiskey and the shirt and
pantaloons Wages had promised the negro, and crossed in the
ferry flat. We made fast the flat, went up the bank and there
we found the negro, true to his promise. Wages gave him the
dram and the shirt and pantaloons. Wages then asked the
negro if he did not want to leave his master and go to a free
State. The negro said he did; that he had runaway three
times in South Carolina and started to Ohio, but was caught
every time. Wages then gave him another dram and asked
him if he could steal three of the best horses on his master’s
plantation, and bring them to that ferry the next night or the
night after. The negro said he could. Wages then told him,
if he would bring the three horses and one bridle and saddle
and go with us, that he would take him to a free State. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
negro promised to do so, and said he could do it next night as
well as any other time and said he had two halters to lead
with, and an old wagon saddle. We told him we had saddles
and bridles. We gave him another dram and let him go, and
we wet our heads and crossed over to the camp.</p>

<p>Next morning we told the wagoners that we would stop a few
days in the vicinity, and rest awhile and hunt. We went on
two or three miles, to the border of the prairie, and took out
our baggage, among which we had two small three-gallon kegs
of whiskey, one full, and the other with about one gallon in.
We paid for hauling our things, bid the wagoners adieu, and
they drove on. We shouldered our baggage, as much as we
could carry; went a short distance from the road and concealed
it; and went back and took the rest to the same place. We
then took our flasks full of whiskey, our two gourds full of
water, and some salt, and went about a mile on the edge of the
prairie, where we built a small fire. We next turned out to
hunt meat. We could find plenty of cattle, but were afraid to
shoot them so near the settlement, for fear of discovery before
we had accomplished our purpose. We hunted some time and
finally came in view of a small grove of trees, about a half
mile distant. Wages and I separated; I went on one side and
he on the other of the grove, and we found a few deer there.
We killed one small buck, which we took back to our camp
and skinned and barbecued him, and eat, and prepared the
rest to take with us. We laid down for a nap and awoke about
an hour by sun; and took our things to where we had the
others concealed. About sunset we eat our supper, took our
bridles, lassoes, guns, and flasks of whiskey, and started back
to the ferry, which we reached about half an hour after dark.
We concealed ourselves near the landing, until about nine
o’clock. Wages then took the ferry flat and went over the
river; I remained on the same side to watch. If we discovered
any person we were to make the noise of the swamp owl.</p>

<p>Wages had been across about an hour when up came the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
negro, with the three horses; Wages immediately took the negro
and horses in the flat and crossed over. We soon put bridles
on the horses and Wages mounted one and I mounted the other—bare
backed. Wages took the lead, the negro next; and I
in behind; we both had our guns well loaded and both cocked,
for fear the negro had betrayed us, and we were determined to
kill with every load in our guns, if attacked. We soon arrived
at the place of our baggage. Wages and I very soon saddled
our horses and divided our baggage and gave a part to the
negro. We then divided the whiskey and had about one
gallon and a half in each keg; I took one and the negro one,
and we tied them to our saddles with the ropes. We filled our
two flasks; Wages took our meat, and about eleven o’clock
that night we all set out, Wages ahead, the negro next and I in
the rear, and I assure you we pushed from the word go, all
that night, mostly through prairies.</p>

<p>Some time before day we came to a settlement, and a little
farther on we came to a small river. Knowing it must be very
low, we determined to ford or swim. We started in; it was
very deep. About the middle, we came to a gravelly bar.
Wages halted, and said to us that he could see a ferry flat; he
believed the water was very deep near the shore, and we must
swim and try and land above the ferry flat. He told me to
take care of my gun and ammunition and to wait until he and
the negro got through and out. They started, and got to the
bank. Such splashing you never did hear. Wages got out;
the negro’s horse bogged; he jumped off and took the bridle,
and the horse got out. Wages then told me to bear up, which
I did, and got through. We then got water, filled our gourds
and took each a dram, mounted our horses and pushed on
again till daylight appeared.</p>

<p>Wages and I then consulted, whether to keep on or lay by
through the day. We concluded it was safer to stop, conceal
the negro and horses, and watch the road. We began to look
out for some woodland, and about half an hour after sunrise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
we descried woodland to the west, at some distance. We made
for it, stripped our horses and hampered them to graze;
took our dram, some water, and eat our breakfast on venison
without bread, and Wages took his gun and went to watch the
road, I took my gun and went west to hunt water. We left
the negro to mind the horses; we took our flasks; each went
his own way. I walked about a mile and came to some prairie
land, and a short distance further I saw woodland and plenty
of cattle and horses; I knew there must be water there. I
hunted and found plenty, but it was very bad. In searching
around, I found a flock of turkeys and killed two and cleaned
and washed them there and went back to the camp. The negro
had been tasting the contents of his keg, as he said, to make
it lighter, and he was pretty tight; I told him he must stop
that until we got further off; he said he would. We made a
fire and roasted our turkeys. I told the negro to go to sleep,
which he did. After he had slept his nap out, I laid down and
told him to watch and wake me about two hours before sunset.
We then put saddles on two horses and led one, and went with
our gourds to the water. Our horses drank <em>some</em>; the negro
drank powerfully—the whiskey he had taken down made his
coppers a little hot. We filled the gourds and returned to
camp, where we had dried all the traveling equipage, and we
then packed and arranged everything, ready to travel when
Wages should return.</p>

<p>About sunset he came in and informed us that no person had
passed the road in pursuit of us; but that two men had passed
the other way, and if we had kept on that day we should in all
probability have got ourselves in trouble, for these men said
they were in pursuit of two thieves who had stolen two horses
and three negroes on the Irish Bayou, in April last, and that
the same thieves were suspected of having poisoned the overseer
on the same plantation. They told Wages they had traveled
nearly all Texas; they had been to San Antonio, and all
western Texas, and could get no news of the fellows. Wages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
then told them that he had a family and resided about twenty
miles from that place, on the next river they would come to,
about ten miles below the ferry; he was looking for his horses;
that he had removed from South Carolina; that he crossed the
Mississippi river about the first of May, and had met two men
with two very good horses and three negroes, and they were
near the river. He described the horses and negroes, and they
declared they were the same that had been stolen. Wages
then inquired if they had seen his horses. They said they
had not. He then said to them: “Gentlemen, I have a little
whiskey in my flask; will you take some?” They replied they
would, if it did not disfurnish him. He told them he should
return to a camp he had, about five miles off, where he had
some comrades helping him to hunt his horses, and they had a
little more there in a small jug. They drank. Wages then
inquired of them about the country south and west of there,
and about the roads and the water, etc. They told him it was
fifteen miles to the first water—a large creek, but fordable; and
that it was twenty-five miles to the next, and that was to ferry.
Wages having obtained the information he required, offered
them his flask again. The sun then was about one hour and
a half high. He saw three men come riding from the same
way we had come; they were riding very fast; they rode up
and inquired which way we were traveling. Wages told them
he lived east of that about twenty miles; was hunting his
horse. The other two men stated they were on the hunt of
some stolen horses and negroes, that were taken from the settlement
on Irish Bayou, in April; that they had been through
western Texas, and were now direct from San Antonio. The
three men enquired how far they had traveled that day. They
said from the last ferry, about forty miles. They then inquired
if the two men had met any person on the road. They replied
no. One of the three then said that some person had stolen a
negro and three horses from them the night before, and they
were in pursuit of them, and they had seen signs where they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
had swam the river, ten miles back. Wages then told them
that just after daylight that morning his dog had awakened
him, and he looked some distance off and saw a white man and
a negro on horseback, traveling a new road, in a southeast
direction, and about twenty miles southeast from that place.
The negro had a lead horse. Then Wages described to them
the horses (which were the same we had). They said they
were the same, and immediately turned their course. Wages
gave them some directions and they all left. Wages then
hurried to our camp as fast as he possibly could.</p>

<p>On his arrival I could see that something was wrong; that
he was irritated, and, I thought, alarmed. He was much exhausted
for want of water; he took a little and a dram, eat a
few mouthfuls of turkey and sat down. He told the negro to
catch the horses, put the bridles on and hitch them, saddle his
own horse, and have everything ready as quick as possible.
The negro started. Wages then said to me: “James, I am
more alarmed now than I ever have been since you and I first
started out in Alabama. Our situation is truly a critical and
dangerous one, and I am at a loss what to do.” He then told
me what information he had that day received, and then asked
me what I thought it best to do. I reflected for a few moments,
and this idea immediately occurred to me, and I said to
Wages: “We must cross that forty-mile ferry before daylight
to-morrow morning.” Wages studied a few moments and said
“agreed!” and we were not long in saddling up and packing
all things, ready to travel. We filled our flasks with whiskey,
gave our negro a good horn, and drilled him as to the mode of
travel. About dark we left our place of concealment.</p>

<p>Wages took the lead, the negro about thirty-five yards behind,
and I about thirty-five yards behind him, so as to evade
any sudden surprise. We soon reached the main road, and
Wages pushed on at a fast gait. In about three hours we
reached the fifteen-mile creek; here we stopped about three-quarters
of an hour, let our horses drink and blow; we got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
water, eat some of our turkey, took a dram, and gave the negro
one, filled our gourds with water, and about eleven o’clock we
started again, Wages in the lead, and traveled until about three
o’clock in the morning. We saw a light near the road; Wages
stopped and came back to me to know if he should ride up
and inquire how far it was to the ferry. I told him no; that
the best way would be to go round the fire and push on, which
we did, and about two or three miles further we came to
woodland and a plantation. We quickened our pace, and
about one mile further, a little before four o’clock, we reached
the ferry. Wages told me to strip off my clothes and he
would do the same. We stripped, and placed the negro in the
bushes with the horses. We swam over and were not many
minutes getting the flat over. We put on our clothes, took the
horses and negro, and crossed over. Our horses drank, and
the negro filled our gourds while we were crossing. We
landed, made the flat fast, as we had found it, mounted the
horses and left in a hurry.</p>

<p>As we got out from the river we could see the appearance of
day. Our horses we could discover were getting very much
fagged. There was a farm at the ferry, and so we went out
through a lane. We did not travel far before day, and we
soon reached the outskirts of the woodland and came again to
the open prairie. Wages then stopped and said we had better
leave the road and lay-by again. We left the road, and went
in a westerly direction, up the river, on the border of the woodland
and prairie, about two miles, and then stopped. We
stripped our horses and hampered them, as usual, to graze.
Wages complained of being sick; was low spirited; I told him
and the negro to lie down and take a nap. They eat some of
my turkey, laid down, and soon went to sleep. I took a good
dram and eat as much turkey as I wanted, and there was but
little left. I then took my gun and hunted around a short distance;
I found we were not more than one mile from a plantation;
I saw plenty of stock, hogs and cattle, but was afraid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
to shoot one so early in the day; I hunted around for water,
and above the plantation I came to the river, about one mile
and a half from where our horses were. I went back to the
camp; Wages and the negro were still asleep; the horses had
filled themselves and were lying down under the shade of a
tree. I took another dram, a little water and laid down to rest.
In about an hour Wages awoke and got up; said he felt better.
I then related to him my discovery; he said we must be very
cautious, and told me to lie down and take a nap. I showed
him the direction where the water was, and he rode one of the
horses at a time, until he gave them all water; he then took the
negro and they went and killed a small beef, and about sunset
brought in the hind quarters. We soon had a fire of wood
that did not make much smoke; roasted as much beef as we
could eat; cut up the balance and dried it; took with us what
we could conveniently carry, and about dark set out again, not
knowing where we would get the next water. Our salt, too,
had given out.</p>

<p>We traveled that night about twenty miles before we came
to water, and that was a small creek that scarcely run, and had
very little timber land about it. Wages said our safest course
would be to conceal ourselves there until he could reconnoitre.
We remained there until near daylight, gave our horses water
and started. We soon struck the prairie, and again turned to
the west and went some two miles along a trail to a piece of
woodland, where we again stripped our horses and hampered
them to graze. We built a fire and barbecued our meat. Wages
then told me and the negro to lie down and sleep, and he would
take a look around. I went to sleep, and about twelve or one
o’clock Wages awoke me, and when I opened my eyes there
was another man with him—a large, dark-skinned, coarse-looking
fellow. Wages introduced me to Mr. James; Wages had
known Ben James for many years. James then told me that
he was settled there for the same business we were in, and that
we would be safer with him than by going on; by remaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
with him we could rest and refresh ourselves and horses, and
that he would go with us to another of our clan, about one
hundred miles from San Antonio, where our negro and horses
would be safe until we left again for the Mississippi river.
This other man’s name was Scott, from Mississippi. James
advised us not to sell the negro or horses in Texas; that there
were plenty of men in Texas who followed hunting and trailing
thieves and robbers, and that they had dogs of the bloodhound
breed that would be certain to overtake us if they got
after us.</p>

<p>We went to James’ place; concealed our horses and negro,
and remained with him five days, during which time Wages
and I watched the road closely to see if any person passed in
pursuit of us, particularly at the ford of the creek.</p>

<p>James provided his family with meat and bread for the two
weeks trip he intended to make with us. He advised us to
leave the main road and go with him to the house of the man
Scott. He piloted us through. We traveled the most of the
way by night, and arrived at Scott’s the fourth night. After
making the proper arrangement with Scott, we sent our horses
out in the mountains and the negro to take care of them, with
a man that Scott had employed for that purpose, for we understood
afterward from James that they always had from one to
two hundred head of stolen horses there, which it was the
business of this man James to steal and drive and sell. We
paid him fifty dollars for piloting us through.</p>

<p>After we had rested and all things were arranged, Wages and
I took our bridles and lassoes, with a few clothes in a small
bundle, and left in a direction for San Antonio. It was now
about the first of August. We traveled about twenty miles the
first day; the weather was very hot, water was scarce, and we
suffered a great deal. We changed our course so as to pass
through a section of country where water was more plentiful,
and on the evening of the second day we reached a settlement
where there was plenty of water and the inhabitants were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
thickly settled. At the house of a very respectable farmer we
stopped and inquired if we could rest two or three days, and
were told we could. A great many questions were asked us
about our journey, where we were from, where we were going,
and the object of our journey; to which we answered them we
were South Carolina planters looking for good land; that we
were large slave holders, etc., and that we came in summer
and took it on foot leisurely to ascertain the health of the
country. We inquired if there were any churches in the vicinity,
and were told there were none, but that traveling preachers
sometimes preached at private houses. We were then informed
that there was to be a large camp meeting about the
middle of August about twenty miles from there. We at once
agreed to attend, because we were almost certain we should
meet McGrath there.</p>

<p>We accordingly attended, and sure enough we met that
reverend gentleman. Through some of the brethren we obtained
an introduction to the Rev. Mr. McGrath, and after the
preliminary conversation we became very strict members of the
church. We obtained a short private interview with McGrath,
and made an appointment for a private conference that night;
and accordingly that night, after supper, preaching and prayer
meeting were over and the patrol was out and stationed, and all
things were still, McGrath, Wages and I went outside of the
patrol lines to hold private prayer. No one suspected anything.
After we were alone McGrath inquired what success we had
met with, and we related to him all we had done, in a condensed
form, which seemed to astonish him when we told him
we had a negro and three line horses yet concealed and not disposed
of. We then inquired his success. He had made a raise
out of the religious brethren of about one thousand dollars, by
begging, and they had paid for four fine horses for him, which
was equivalent to about five hundred dollars more. He would
sell his horse, saddle and bridle, and go to his congregation
and tell them he had been robbed of his horse and all his money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
and clothes. The people would throw into the “hat,” and buy
another horse, and fit him out with new clothes and money.
The horse he then had was given him about fifty miles from
there, and if we would steal his horse and hide him the brethren
would soon give him another. Wages did this the next
night, and concealed the horse in the woods not far from a
plantation, where he procured green corn to feed him, about
five miles from the camp ground. Next day there was found
a piece of broken rope to the tree, and the preacher’s horse was
gone. There was a great noise about it. McGrath told the
brethren he thought he knew the place the horse would go to,
and that he could obtain him if he had another horse. They
furnished him with one, which he was to return if he obtained
his own. The one furnished was a splendid young horse.
Wages, about an hour before sunset, would stroll off and go to
where the horse was, and water and feed him about dark, and
back to supper and then to prayer.</p>

<p>The meeting lasted four days. The night before the meeting
broke up, there was another preacher’s horse that went the
same way. He was a remarkable fine horse, and belonged to
an old preacher who lived about seventy miles from the camp
ground. We now had ourselves again on horseback. It was
then understood between Wages, McGrath and myself that it
would not be safe for us to go to San Antonio, and that we had
better leave Texas as soon as possible. We arranged with
McGrath to meet us at Scott’s in three days. Wages and I
called on some of the preachers to pray for us, announcing to
them our departure on our exploring expedition on foot.
Many of the brothers and sisters joined in this prayer. After
receiving the benedictions of the elders of the church, Wages
and I left about three o’clock. We had left our guns at a
house about two miles distant from the camp ground. We
took them, procured some bread and meat, and a bottle to
carry some water, and then went to the place where Wages had
concealed the horses, found them safe, and more green corn
around them than they could have eaten in two days. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
then took out our bridles from our bundles and fitted them on.
Wages had stolen blankets with the horses, and two bed
quilts. We arranged these to ride on, and with our ropes or
lassoes, we made substitutes for stirrups. By this time it was
sundown. We took our guns and looked around to see if there
were any spies out. We saw no one except the people on the
farm, driving in their stock. We returned to the horses, and
about dark set out. Wages took the lead on McGrath’s horse,
a fine traveler, and I, on the other, just walked right up to
him. We traveled about six miles an hour and did not push.
Before day sometime, we had traveled some forty-five miles to
a creek, and knew we were within twenty or twenty-five miles
of Scott’s. We laid by all next day. About sundown, we
again started, and reached Scott’s before that night.</p>

<p>Long before daylight next morning, our horses were sent off
to the mountains with the others. The next day up rolled
the Rev. Mr. McGrath. We introduced him as the Rev. Mr.
McGrath, whom we had seen in South Carolina. Mr. Scott
and family invited him to spend two or three days, during
which time Wages, McGrath and I had a full consultation.</p>

<p>Having been with Wages so long, I knew his judgment to
be superior to mine, and I knew that McGrath was wanting in
stability; that he was too wild and uncertain in his actions; I
therefore proposed to let Wages plan out our future course,
which McGrath agreed to. Wages then said: “Boys, it is
time some of us were leaving Texas—particularly James and
I. Mac, you can remain here as a striker for us, until we get
those negroes you have described to us. You say there are
seven of them—two men and their wives, one of them with
one and the other with two children, and the youngest child is
about four years old. They will have to be carried away by
water. We never can get them away by land, and the Christmas
holidays will be the only time that we can effect that with
safety.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Wages, “my plan is this: You leave here before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
we do, one or two days, and wait for us at some point and
pilot us through to Red river, above Shreveport, where we can
cross with our negro and horses and land in the Indian Nation.
You can then remain and preach around until Christmas;
you appoint a two or three days’ meeting for the negroes
near Red River; pretend to prevent frolic and drunkenness,
and about that time James and I will be on hand, with a boat
to effect our object; and it will be policy,” said Wages to
McGrath, “for you to remain some weeks after we are off with
the negroes, and meet us at Natchez or Vicksburg.”</p>

<p>McGrath agreed to this; directed us what route to take;
promised that he would meet us at a river, about sixty miles
from Scott’s, on the fifth night from that time, and that he
would wait there for us. On the morning of the fourth day
McGrath bid farewell to Mr. Scott and family, promising to
call and see them again, God willing. We remained two days
longer; prepared ourselves with some packs and provisions,
and went to the mountains where our horses were. We paid
Scott fifty dollars for his trouble. We packed our horses and
led them; Scott sent a pilot with us, to conduct us through
the mountains, a by-way, about forty miles, which we traveled
in two days; he then put us in the road to go to where we
were to meet McGrath, and we met him on the night appointed.
He had all things in readiness. We crossed the river and laid
by in daytime and traveled by night, McGrath with us.</p>

<p>He would go ahead to houses, lay by and sleep, and pray for
the people; and tell them that he traveled of a night from
choice, on account of the heat. On the third morning after
McGrath joined us, we arrived at a good place, where there
was plenty of water, about thirty-five miles from Red river.
There we told McGrath to ride on ahead, get his horse fed,
and breakfast, and then go on to the ferry. This he did; he
crossed over and stopped near the landing. The ferryman
was a negro; McGrath procured a bottle of whiskey, to which
he had added plenty of opium, and treated the ferryman liberally.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
He tied his horse up, got corn from the ferryman, and
by eleven o’clock he had the ferryman as limber as a cotton
rag. He then took the ferry flat and crossed over to meet us.
We got to the ferry about two o’clock, crossed over and traveled
until daylight, McGrath with us. After day we turned
off from the road to a place where some Indian families lived,
and there bought some corn, meat and bread, and fed our
horses and ourselves, and rested that day, and started again
that night, McGrath with us. That night we traveled about
forty miles; next morning we traveled until we found a place
off the main road where we could rest secure. Here we stopped
again with Indians. We procured plenty for ourselves and
horses, and rested that day. Here we made our arrangements
permanent, and reduced them to black and white, in our usual
mystic character. We were to meet above Shreveport a few
miles, on the 20th of December coming, with a proper skiff,
prepared with provisions, etc.</p>

<p>All matters thus arranged, McGrath took off his traveling
hunting shirt and straw hat; put on his long, straight-breasted
bombazine coat and his broad-brimmed black beaver, and gave
us a sound of his colloquial benediction of, “Hark from the
tombs, gentlemen,” and steered his course southeast, into
Louisiana towards Alexandria; whilst we steered our course to
the northeast in the direction for the Washita below Monroe,
some fifty miles.</p>

<p>We soon got into the settlements and began to feed and rub
our horses and blanket them. It was now September; cotton
was to pick out, plenty; we persuaded our negro he had better
pick out cotton a while, until we could sell the horses and get
money to carry us to Cincinnati; he agreed. We cautioned him
about answering questions, which he had his instructions how
to answer. We hired him to a man in an obscure place on
Black River or Bayou; we traveled out through the country
and soon sold our fine horses and for a fine price. We got from
one hundred and seventy-five to two hundred and thirty dollars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
apiece. We sold all the horses before the first of October;
they averaged us a little short of a thousand dollars. While
selling, we met with a man by the name of Harden; he said
he was a distant relation of John Harden. He had been selling
negroes from Tennessee; he soon made us know, and we
soon made him know, that we were all of the same family; we
then conversed freely. He told us that he was clear—that he
had sold out, and was overrun with money. We told him we
had one darkey on hand; he said he would go with us and look
at our negro; and did go. He told the negro that he lived in
Cincinnati; was agent for an Abolition society, and that he
would like to take him there. The negro agreed, and was very
anxious. Harden then told Wages and myself that if we
would deliver him the negro at Napoleon, Arkansas, he would
give us one thousand dollars for him. We agreed, and the
day was set to deliver him. Harden then told the negro that
he had to go to Natchez, and would meet us at the mouth of
the Arkansas river. We now disposed of our saddles and
bridles, and took our negro and packs, and made for the Mississippi
river at Vicksburg, where we got on a steamboat for
Napoleon. We landed, and again set our darkey to picking
out cotton. Harden came in a few days, paid the thousand
dollars, and took the negro. He requested us to remain there
a few days. We made him a bill of sale in the name of the
negro’s master—Smith, by which name I passed. Wages
passed as Mr. Jones and Harden by the name of John Newton.
He was the same man that afterward, in 1843, murdered
old Robert Lott. Harden then went with me to take his negro.
I told the negro that his master had just landed in pursuit of
him, and that he must go with Mr. Newton; it was his only
chance to escape; that if he was found we should all be hanged,
and he carried back to Texas. He agreed, and Harden went
up the Arkansas river about twenty-five miles and sold the
negro for twelve hundred and fifty dollars; got a draft on New
Orleans for his money, payable in ninety days; was gone only
four days, and returned to Napoleon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>Wages and I then informed him of our contemplated trip to
Louisiana, about Christmas, and consulted with him as to the
mode of operation. He and Wages both agreed in opinion,
and Harden suggested to us that the best plan would be to go
to Cincinnati and procure a good skiff, large enough to carry
twenty persons, and fit her out with six row-locks and six
good oars; pretend her for a peddling boat on Red
river; lay in some whiskey, bacon, flour and other articles to
trade upon; and have the boat towed down to the mouth of
Red river or Bayou Sara; land the freight; take the first Red
river boat up to Shreveport; there fit out the skiff and go up
the river trading, until the opportunity to steal the negroes is
offered.</p>

<p>This arrangement understood, Harden proposed to join us;
go to Cincinnati with us, and take chances. We all took the
first boat that passed, the “Tribune,” bound to Pittsburg, and
passed Louisville and landed in Cincinnati the ninth day. We
immediately made a contract to have the skiff built; it was to
be ready in two weeks, and was to be large enough to carry
twenty-five barrels of freight, and to be long and narrow, so
as to row swift. During the time the boat was building, we
made some purchases of whiskey, flour, bacon and other produce,
and during our stay in Cincinnati we all pretended to be
strong Abolitionists, attended several private meetings, and
formed acquaintance with several free negroes, to whom we
communicated our intention to steal the seven negroes near
Shreveport, and bring them to Cincinnati. They very much
approved the idea. We then proposed for two of them to go
with us and assist in bringing the negroes away. There were
two of them, that had been employed as stewards on board of
steamboats, that agreed to go, and they took situations on a
steamboat for that purpose.</p>

<p>Our skiff being finished and all accounts settled, we contracted
with the captain of a steamboat on which our two free
darkies were employed, to take our freight and tow our skiff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
to Bayou Sara. The passage was long, on account of low
water. We arrived at Bayou Sara about the tenth of November,
and landed our freight and skiff. Wages and I stopped;
Harden and the two free negroes went on. Harden to get his
draft accepted, and the free darkies to get on a Red river boat;
and they were all to make an arrangement for a boat bound to
Shreveport, to call and take us and our freight.</p>

<p>After they left, Wages went to see our old friend, Mr. Welter,
relative to the arrangement and disposal of our two free
darkies. An arrangement was soon made, for our old friend
W., knew the ropes too well to hesitate long.</p>

<p>About the twentieth of November a small steamboat landed
(on board were Harden and our two darkies,) which had been
specially employed to take our freight. We shipped our freight
and took the skiff in tow and put off. On the way up, Wages,
Harden and I made the necessary arrangement for our future
plan of action. Harden was to go with us to Shreveport, and
there feign himself sick; and let Wages and I take our two
darkies in the skiff and our freight, and start up the river.
Accordingly, we reached Shreveport about the fifth of December,
and Harden was taken sick; Wages and I hurried our
darkies, loaded our skiff and left for up the river. We went up
the river to the ferry we had crossed with McGrath, and there
we stopped. I went to selling, sometimes to Indians, sometime
to whites, and very often to negroes. Wages procured
a horse and saddle and put out in pursuit of McGrath, and
found him at the house of the old Methodist that owned the
seven negroes we were after. McGrath was sick; had been
very sick; but was then able to walk about and take occasional
rides. Wages and McGrath got an opportunity to have a
private interview for a few minutes. They were to meet the
next day on the road, five miles from that place. Wages
staid all night, paid his bill next morning and left after breakfast,
enquiring for some stray mules. McGrath started for
the residence of a brother Methodist, some ten miles distant—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
they both met at the place appointed and held their consultation.</p>

<p>The negro camp meeting had been already appointed, about
ten or twelve miles above Shreveport and about two miles from
the river. Wages and McGrath having fully understood how
to act, Wages told him where the boat could be found, ten
days before Christmas, and they parted, and Wages returned.</p>

<p>Accordingly, at the time appointed, McGrath was at the
boat. We had him and his horse provided for; he was made
acquainted with our two free darkies, and all things were arranged
and understood well that night. McGrath left next
morning to prepare for the camp meeting, which was to commence
in eight days. We loitered away our time; and two
days before the commencement of the camp meeting, we dropped
our skiff to a landing opposite the camp ground, where we
lay trading. We had sold almost everything we had.</p>

<p>On the morning of the commencement of the meeting, we
set our two free darkies over the river, and they went to the
place early in the day. Wages and I cleared out our skiff of
all barrels, boxes and dunnage of every description, and had
everything in complete trim, row locks, oars and all ready. The
meeting commenced. We had instructed our free darkies to
what landing place to conduct these seven negroes we were
stealing; and on the first night of the meeting, sure enough
they all came to us. Their master had furnished them with
two mules and a wagon, to haul their bedding, etc., to the camp
ground, and they had brought all their clothing, bedding, and
everything they had. They informed us that they had sold
all their poultry and crop, and had got money to support them
for the year. They had procured another negro to drive the
mules and wagon back to the camp ground; and by nine
o’clock that night we were under way down stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>


<h3 id="WELTER_AND_HARDENS_DECEPTION">WELTER AND HARDEN’S DECEPTION—WELTER ACTING AS UNITED
STATES MARSHAL.</h3>

<p>We rigged all six of the oars; one of the women pulled one
oar and I pulled one; Wages sometimes spelled me, and I would
steer the boat, and the women would sometimes spell each
other, and we run at the rate of about ten miles an hour.
About eleven o’clock that night we passed Shreveport, and
before day sometime, we passed Natchitoches, the point we
were striving to make, for we knew there was a bayou about
five miles below, where we could hide ourselves and skiff
through the day. We put into the bayou a little before day,
and at daylight we landed our skiff in some bushes and high
grass, and we all went on shore in a thick palmetto swamp,
built a good fire, cooked and eat, and drank good whiskey
and every one slept what they wanted; and about sunset we
left and rowed into the river again. By this time they all had
got themselves more accustomed to rowing, and made better
headway and with more ease. We run on in the night and
lay-by in the day; and the third night we reached the mouth
of Red River and lay in the swamp that day; and the fourth
night, about midnight, we reached Tunica, and run our skiff
in a creek just above; made a fire in the swamp and remained
till daylight. After daylight sometime, we eat breakfast and
Wages and I made an excuse to go to the village of Tunica to
buy some cigars, and to get some eggs, etc. The negroes set
us over with the skiff; we went down to the village and went
to the tavern. There we found our old friend, Welter, and
Harden, and three other men whom Welter introduced us to as
his friends and acquaintances, but they were in fact his “strikers.”
Harden immediately after we left him at Shreveport
had gone down the river to Welter’s and informed him where
to meet us.</p>

<p>We held a consultation as to the best plan to pursue, and
we all finally agreed that the safest and best plan was to let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
Welter take all the negroes and pay us for them. He was to
pay Harden for the two free fellows one thousand dollars in
cash and his note for one thousand payable in six months. He
was to pay Wages and I for our seven negroes and the skiff
with all the apparatus, eight hundred dollars in cash and his
note for four thousand dollars, payable in six months. After
this arrangement was concluded Wages and I went to the skiff,
took our guns to go a hunting, and then returned to the village.
About two hours before sunset Welter took Harden and his
three men, got a small boat and went up to the creek where all
the negroes were. But before they got to the place they tied
Harden’s hands behind him to make the negroes believe that
he was a prisoner for negro stealing. Welter and his men surrounded
the camp and took all the negroes prisoners, and then
brought up Harden tied. Welter then informed the two free
negroes that he was the United States Marshal, and that it
was his duty to take them and Harden back to Shreveport,
where they would be tried for the crime of negro stealing, and
that the punishment would be death or the penitentiary for
life; but that he did not know that he could prove Harden
guilty, and then asked them if Harden had been with them.
They declared he had not. Welter then told the negroes that
he knew them; that they had been stolen once before and sold
in Louisiana, and that he knew all about them, and made them
confess the truth. He then told the free negroes that their
case was a desperate one; that it would be impossible for them
to escape; and then asked them which they would prefer, to
stand their trial or be sold as slaves for life. They said they
had rather be sold as slaves; so he tied their feet, after putting
them in the boat, and took in all their dunnage, and the other
seven negroes. Upon their positive declaration that Harden
was not concerned he was released, and a little after dark they
rowed down to the village. Welter placed his three “strikers”
to guard the boat and negroes, while he and Harden went on
shore, and we all went into a private room in the tavern, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
we executed bills of sale for the negroes, dated them in Buncombe
county, N. C., and signed fictitious names and witnesses.
Welter paid us our money according to contract and executed
the notes, after which we took a good supper together and
drank three or four bottles of wine, and Welter left us. We
went with him nearly to his boat and bid him good-by and
good luck, and he rowed off down the river for home. Wages,
Harden and I returned to the tavern, went to our room and to
bed and slept very sound. Next morning we arose much refreshed,
and greatly relieved in mind. We went very early to
a coffee house, took a cup of coffee and our bitters, and returned
to our room to consult as to the best course to pursue.
We concluded to leave in the first boat for Natchez. We accordingly
got breakfast, paid our bills and placed our guns and
baggage at the nearest depot to the landing. We had to wait
till late in the day before we could get a boat. We at last saw
one coming, and procured a skiff to put us on board. At a
signal the boat rounded to, and we went on board, registered
our names (all fictitious) and paid our passage to Natchez.</p>


<h3 id="WAGES_AND_HARDENS_PLOT">WAGES’ AND HARDEN’S PLOT TO KILL ROBERT LOTT AND THOMAS
SUMRALL.</h3>

<p>When we landed at Natchez we all stopped at different hotels,
but while there, some ten days, we had interviews and consultations
every day. It was then that Wages and Harden made
the plot to kill old Thomas Sumrall and old Robert Lott, and
for that purpose Wages furnished Harden a map of all the
roads in Perry county, Miss. Harden then informed us that
he had a partner in Tennessee by the name of Goodwin, and
that he expected Goodwin had, in a cave in the Cumberland
mountains, several negroes then waiting for him to run off and
sell, and that he must go up with the first rise of water so as
to come down with the spring freshet. We all then made an
arrangement to meet in New Orleans at a certain place on the
Fourth of July coming, so as to collect our money from Welter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
and for Harden to get the money on his draft for the negro
sold on the Arkansas river, which he had deposited in bank for
collection.</p>

<p>Our ten days in Natchez having expired, Harden and I took
passage on a steamboat, Harden for Tennessee, and I for Vicksburg
to await the arrival of McGrath. Wages was to be at
Vicksburg in three or four days. I landed at Vicksburg; Harden
went on. I went to one of the hotels, put up and waited
for McGrath. On the sixth day Wages came, and went to
another hotel, and we both waited there another week and still
no McGrath. We began to get uneasy. However, three or
four days after, I was standing on the bank of the river, when I
saw a man dressed in coarse negro clothing, black and ragged,
an old flapped hat, a pair of old saddle-bags on his arm and a
big stick in his hand. He came up to me to inquire the road
to Jackson. I did not know him at first, but he soon made me
know him. It was McGrath. He inquired for Wages; I told
him Wages was there; I told him to go to the cheapest boarding
house, which he did, and his appearance caused him to have
to pay his dollar in advance. That night we all got together,
Wages, McGrath and myself; we went below the city and had a
long consultation. We told McGrath what we had done, and
gave him a full history of Harden and his two free negroes, and
where Harden had gone, etc. He next gave us a detail of his
voyage through the camp meeting and since, up to that time.</p>

<p>He said the next day after the seven negroes had left the
camp ground he saw their mules and wagon, and no person appeared
to be about them. A very likely young negro watered
and sometimes fed the mules, and on the second day he went to
the negro and asked what had become of the negroes that came
with that wagon and mules. The boy answered first he did not
know, and looked confused. He then said to the negro to tell
him the truth and he would keep the secret and not expose him;
the negro then told him the whole truth about the matter, and
then asked McGrath’s advice. He told him to take care of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
the mules and wagon until the meeting broke up, and then
take them to their owner, and inquire of him why his negroes
went off and left their mules and wagon so long, and not return
at all, and give him the trouble to bring them home; and
if any person attempted to whip him to make him tell anything
about the matter he was to run away, and on the next Sunday
night to meet him, McGrath, at a certain place and he would
tell him what to do, and to be sure and keep everything a profound
secret.</p>


<h3 id="MR_MOORE_AFTER_PREACHER">MR. MOORE AFTER PREACHER M’GRATH, IN TEXAS.</h3>

<p>With this understanding the meeting went on until the sixth
day; the meeting broke up; the negro geared up his mules to
the wagon and rolled off; drove them to the house of the owner
and reported himself. It was late in the night. The old gentleman
told him to feed the mules, get his supper and come to
him in the morning and tell him more about it. The next
morning the boy told the old man that he did not know but one
of his negroes, and that was the fellow that asked him to feed
and water the mules a day or two, and on the third day the
negro did not return, and he asked the advice of one of the
preachers, who told him to take them home. The old man
asked the boy where that preacher was, and the negro said he
was sick at a house about six miles from there. He then asked
the boy who he belonged to, and the negro showed him his
“pass,” which told the truth. He then dismissed the boy and
sent him home, and about ten o’clock, McGrath said, “here
comes the old man.” He rode up to the gate and hailed, and
inquired if Brother McGrath was there. They told him he was.
He alighted from his horse, came into the house and said good
morning, very short. “Well, Brother McGrath, how do you
do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am very sick, Brother Moore.”</p>

<p>“What seems to be the matter?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have caught a cold, and have a very severe pain in
my side; I think it is side pleurisy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” said he, “did you see anything of my negroes at
your meeting?”</p>

<p>McGrath told him: “I saw them there the first day with
you when we went. After you left, Brother Moore, I don’t
recollect seeing them, and I thought you had ordered them
home until I was asked by a strange negro what he should do
with the mules and wagon. When I examined them I saw they
were yours, and I told the negro to drive them to you and report
himself. I would have gone with him, but was too unwell
and had to stop here.”</p>

<p>“Well,” says the old man, “your great meeting has caused
me to lose seven negroes, I fear.”</p>

<p>McGrath said: “Oh, I hope not, Brother Moore.”</p>

<p>“Yes it has!” said he very short, “and I wish there never
had been a camp meeting in the world; and I know,” said he,
“they are stolen, and they went by water. Some of them
picayune steamboat captains have stolen them, and they are
now in Florida or Georgia. I will go and make some inquiry
in Shreveport, and along the river, to find out what boats left
about that time, and,” said he, “I will go to the owner of that
negro that brought the wagon home and have him tied up and
whipped till he tells the truth about it, for I believe he knows
all about the matter.” McGrath said he tried to pacify the old
gentleman, but it was all no go, so the old gentleman left.</p>

<p>McGrath said the times then were beginning to be rather
equally. He pretended to improve very fast; was able to ride
in two days, and set out to help Brother Moore hunt and track
his negroes. On the next Sunday night he was at the place
where he was to meet the negro, and the negro was there also.
McGrath told of the threats against him, and asked him if he
wished to run away and go with him, if he did he would find
him a good master, or take him to a free State. The negro
said he would go. McGrath asked him if he could steal a good
horse, saddle and bridle. The negro said he could. McGrath
then asked him if he could get over Red river and meet him at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
a certain place on a certain day. He said he could, three or
four days after.</p>

<p>McGrath then went to the house of Brother Moore to inquire
if he had got any tidings of, or from his negroes. The old man
was very mad and talked very short, and said “no,” adding:
“Mr. McGrath, I want you to leave my house, and never again
set your foot in it.” McGrath tried to reason with the old man,
but all would not do, so he left. He had collected among the
brethren some five hundred dollars or upward and a considerable
sum from the negroes at the camp meeting. He then
went to Shreveport and procured some articles he wanted (and
among them two half gallon jugs, one full of brandy and the
other of whiskey), some bread and cheese, and crossed the
river.</p>

<p>After he got across he saw three men come down to the ferry
and wait for the ferryman; he watched them; they conversed
with the ferryman awhile and rode back. McGrath rode on
three or four miles, came to an inn and stopped. It was not
night, but he had come to the conclusion now, that it was
necessary for him to watch as well as pray. A little after dark
up rode three men, and inquired if a traveler had passed that
evening, and what time—how long before dark? They were
informed none had passed; one had put up, a little before dark.
They alighted and came in; enquired from McGrath his name,
where he was traveling, his occupation, etc. He told his
name, and said he was going to a quarterly meeting, some
seventy-five miles from that place. They listened to him with
keen, shrewd looks and very doubting air, and McGrath saw
from their manœuvres that they were after him in particular,
and he well knew it would require his best skill and ingenuity
to evade their vigilance. They bid him good night and started on.
McGrath pretended to walk out carelessly and watch them;
they turned back.</p>

<p>He started next morning and traveled about thirty-five miles
and stopped for the night. Just before night, the same three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
men passed the house. Next morning, after breakfast, he
started again, and in a few miles came to their camp. “Well,”
said one, “we have met again.” McGrath said “yes,” and
asked them which way they were going. They said to purchase
beef cattle, and asked him how much further he was
going that route? He told them he was going to a missionary
station to see the preacher there; that it was about forty miles
there, and he wanted to get there that night. He bid them
good morning, rode off, and traveled slow until he got out of
their sight, and then pushed and rode about twelve miles. He
came to a cross road that passed near where the negro was;
here he left the road in a direction opposite to where the negro
lay; tied his horse in a thicket some distance from the road,
and concealed himself to watch. The men soon came to the
place and examined for the track of his horse; they finally
took the road which the horse’s track had followed and
pushed on. He went to where his horse was, stripped him,
held him to graze some cane, and took a little of his good
brandy; stripped his Methodist coat off and rolled up his
broad-brimmed beaver in it and tied them on his saddle; and
put on a common oiled cap, and another coat. Night came on;
he saddled his horse and rode through the woods, near the
road, to the distance of about two miles from where the negro
was to meet him, and tied his horse about two hundred yards
from the road. After it was fully dark, he started on the road
on foot and left his horse, for the place appointed to meet the
negro; and his only fear then was that the negro might have
been bribed to betray him. He had two good single-barrelled
pistols, and would be certain to save two of his assailants and
take chances with the balance. He went on, got within a very
short distance of the place appointed, crept up very close and
stopped to listen. All was still. He discovered, a short distance
from him, a large tree and a thick bunch of bushes
around it. He crept easily to that, and squatted down at the
root of the tree to listen. He thought he heard a stick crack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
or break close to him. He then gave a low whistle like that of
a bird; it was answered immediately, within twenty feet of
him. He then gave another, which was as promptly answered.
He then gave a slap of his hands, which was answered, and the
negro advanced to him. He asked the negro if there was any
person about, and where was his horse? The negro told him
about two hundred yards from there.</p>

<p>They started and went about half way, and McGrath stopped
and told the negro to go and bring his horse there. The negro
went and brought his horse. McGrath said he then became
better satisfied that the negro was no traitor, and told him to
go with him to the road and ride about thirty yards behind,
until they got opposite where his horse was, which he did.
They were not long in getting there. When we got to the
place, he made a signal, and the negro rode up, and McGrath
turned square off from the road and told the negro to follow
him. He went about one hundred yards and told the negro
to tie his horse and go back and watch the road, until he
saddled and brought his horse. When McGrath had saddled
his horse and returned, he found the negro at his horse, with
everything ready to mount and be off. He asked what was
the matter? “My God, master! we have had good luck; just
as I went up close to the road I heard horses’ feet, and hid in
the bushes; I saw by starlight three persons pass the road;
two of them I could see had guns, and if we had been ten
minutes later we should have met them.” McGrath pulled out
his little jug of whiskey and gave the negro two drams and
took one himself; they mounted their horses and started. He
instructed the negro to travel about thirty yards behind in
case of surprise, so as to make his escape and save them both.</p>

<p>They traveled hard that night, and by daylight they had
made near sixty miles. At daylight they left the road and
lay-by that day. It happened that the negro had near a half
bushel of corn, and some meat and bread, and McGrath some
bread and cheese, so they made out pretty well that day. Night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
came on and they set out again, and traveled until near day.
They arrived close to a ferry on the Washita. Before getting
there, they left the road a short distance, and McGrath left the
negro with the horses and went towards the ferry. As he got
near the ferry house, which he intended to go round, some
person hailed—“who is that?” He turned his course and
made back for the negro and horses. He had not time to get
away before they passed in pursuit, and he heard them say,
“that damned preacher is here somewhere, and we will have
him yet.” They halted a moment, and he heard their horses’
feet, some going back and some the other way. McGrath
mounted his horse and told the negro to follow him, and he
took to the woods and steered a west course, which he knew
was up the river, and traveled till he reached high land, and
continued after day until near twelve o’clock, sometimes in
sight of plantations, which he would go round.</p>

<p>By and by he came to a road that had the appearance of being
much traveled, and leading north. Here, some distance
from the road, he halted, stripped their horses and let them
graze in a cane-brake, and remained there till dark without
anything to eat. At dark they started and traveled ten or
twelve miles, passed several houses, and came to a house and
passed down a hill into a lane, and at a short distance came to
high timber land, which he knew was near the river. He
stopped and left the negro with the two horses, giving him
instructions if any alarm was heard, to turn and run back to a
little branch and stop till he came. He went on to the river,
and luckily there was no spy there, and the ferry-flat was on
his side. He hurried back, took his horse and the negro and
his horse, and got into the ferry-flat and went over. They
mounted their horses and traveled until daylight; passed several
houses and plantations. At daylight he found himself
bordering on the Mississippi swamp. He turned off the road
and stripped their horses to graze in a cane-brake.</p>

<p>Nothing to eat now for two nights and one day, with plenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
of money, but was afraid to go to a house, for fear of discovery.</p>

<p>He went to waylay the road, saw no person pass except emigrants,
from whom we obtained a little bread, some salt and a
small piece of meat. He inquired of them the road and distance
to Vicksburg. They told him from seventy-five to one
hundred miles. He inquired if they had met any person on
horseback. They said no. He then left them and returned to
his negro and horses; found the negro had killed a large, fat
possum, and had it cleaned and was roasting it; the salt he
had got then came in play. They cooked and eat, drank their
liquor, and rested that day. A little before night McGrath
went to the road to examine if any horses’ tracks passing
toward Vicksburg could be seen. There were none. He returned
and saddled his horses, and a little before sunset they
started and traveled all night, and until next day at ten o’clock.
They came to the Tensas Bayou, crossed at a ferry, and inquired
of the ferryman, who was a negro, how far it was to
Vicksburg? The negro said about thirty miles. McGrath
then inquired if there were many settlers on the bayou. The
negro said there were plenty up and down the bayou on both
sides. They left the ferry and went on a few miles, and
turned to the west from the main road, up the bayou, along a
new road that carriages had traveled, and went about ten
miles—passed several large plantations. About twelve o’clock
he came to the house of a small farmer; his horses were very
tired, and he asked if he could get his horses fed and some
dinner for himself and boy. The man told him to alight; the
horses were soon attended to, and dinner was soon prepared
and they eat.</p>

<p>McGrath then told the man he was from Mississippi; the
negro he had with him was all he had; that they were about to
sell him for a security debt; that he had to run him to save
him; and that he had to travel a long distance and was much
fatigued, both himself and horses, and that he would like to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
rest himself and horses a few days. This was agreed to. He
then told the landlord that he was fearful they might follow
him and that he did not wish to let many people know that he
was there. He also told him that he would like to sell his
negro, if he could get a good master for him, and that he would
like to sell his two horses and go home by water, by way of
New Orleans, Mobile and up the Tombigbee river. He also
promised his landlord, if he would help him, and effect a good
sale of his negro and horse, that he would make him a present
of one hundred dollars, and that the negro might work in his
farm while they were looking around. This was also agreed to,
and it was concluded to rest the horses a week.</p>

<p>McGrath and the landlord (Mr. Chance was his name) rode
up the bayou to see a blacksmith that wanted to purchase a
negro. They traveled about thirty miles; saw the man and
made a conditional trade with him, to sell him the negro for
thirteen hundred and fifty dollars, if the negro could “blow and
strike” in the shop, which the negro said he could. They then
returned to Chance’s, took the negro and the two horses and
returned to the blacksmith. He tried the negro one day and
said he was satisfied, and paid McGrath his money. The
negro then told his new master to buy the horse that he had
ridden; there was no better horse in the world. The master
inquired the price; McGrath told him two hundred dollars; but
as he had bought the negro he might have the horse for one
hundred and seventy-five dollars. The blacksmith told him
he would have to borrow one hundred and twenty-five dollars,
but he knew where he could get it if they would wait until
the next day; and he thought he knew a man that would give
two hundred dollars for McGrath’s horse. They consented
to wait, and sure enough the next morning quite early the
blacksmith returned with the money and a man with him, who
soon closed the trade with McGrath for his horse, and they
paid him the money for the two horses, saddles and bridles,
three hundred and seventy five dollars, making the whole sum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
seventeen hundred and twenty-five dollars. McGrath gave the
negro one hundred dollars as a present, and asked him if he
was satisfied. He said he was well satisfied. McGrath and
Mr. Chance they left for Chance’s residence, which they reached
that night.</p>


<h3 id="MGRATH_IN_DISGUISE">M’GRATH IN DISGUISE.</h3>

<p>On their way down McGrath made a bargain with Chance to
carry him in his little wagon to the ferry opposite Vicksburg,
for fifteen dollars. The next day he paid Chance one hundred
and fifteen dollars; made the landlady, Mrs. Chance, a present
of ten dollars for her trouble; and after dinner they started
for Vicksburg landing. He told Chance he wished to travel
in disguise for fear he might be followed, and for that purpose
Chance procured for him a negro’s old jacket and trowsers,
and an old flapped hat and Chance’s old saddle bags; “and in
this garb,” said McGrath, “I landed on the other side of the
river last night and camped there with my friend Mr. Chance.
We parted early this morning, he for home, and I for this
place; and here I am this 25th day of January, 1841, and”
said he, “I have kept a regular diary of my travels ever since
we parted on Red River, before the camp meeting,” and he
showed us his memorandum book.</p>

<p>Now, Wages, McGrath and I had all got together again.
We had realized over twenty-five thousand dollars by our hypocrisy,
stealing, burning and murdering. We advised
McGrath to change his clothes and put on a genteel suit, and
procure a pair of green goggles, so as to disguise himself, and
we repaired each to our hotels. The next day McGrath came
out in a new suit, with his green goggles, and we should not
have known him ourselves, had we not been on the look out
for him. He came to the same hotel where I boarded. We
advised McGrath to leave in the first boat for St. Louis, where
we were to meet him on a certain day; but each of us was now
to travel in separate boats. McGrath set out the next day;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
two days after Wages left; and one day after that I took a
boat, and we all met at the time appointed. We remained in
St. Louis a few days, and changed our clothing to that of common
laborers.</p>


<h3 id="MURDER_OF_OCONNOR">MURDER OF O’CONNOR ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.</h3>

<p>We all took passage on a steamboat bound from St. Louis to
Pittsburg; landed at the mouth of the Wabash, and traveled
up that river to the town of ——, where we fell in
with an old Irishman by the name of O’Connor. He was a
western trader, and had two large flat boats loaded with flour,
bulk pork, onions, potatoes, butter, some whiskey, and a variety
of other articles, to the amount of over five thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>With him McGrath soon formed acquaintance, and came
the “country” over him. His brother Irishman, McGrath,
represented to him that our occupation was that of working
flatboats; and that we had made many trips from Missouri,
Indiana, Illinois and Ohio. We were not long in making a
contract with him, to help him down with his boats. He had
contracted for one hundred barrels of whiskey, which he could
have if he could pay five hundred dollars. We advanced him
some money and he made the purchase and gave his note for
the balance. We put the whiskey on board the boats, and all
things being ready we set off down the river.</p>

<p>He employed two extra hands to help us down to the mouth
of the river, where he discharged them. We went on down,
two hands on each boat, until we passed the shoal at Smithland,
the mouth of the Cumberland river, when we lashed the
two boats together and took our watches by turns, two at a
time. We floated all one day and part of a night, and came to
the mouth of the Ohio, between midnight and daylight.</p>

<p>It was the turn for Wages and I to take the watch that morning.
Now, on the Mississippi River, all we had to do was to
keep the boats in the middle of the stream, with a light on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
deck to guard against steamboats. The old Irishman, the
owner of the boats, went down into a small cabin in one of the
boats, which he had prepared for himself, and laid down in his
berth to sleep. He was much fatigued, but before he went to
sleep, Wages proposed to him to take a dram of stewed whiskey
punch, hot, which he knew to be a favorite beverage with
the Irish. The old man consented, and Wages went to work
to prepare it. We being on the alert for any and everything,
had the opium ready, and gave his bowl a full charge.
He drank it down and praised it as very nice, and retired. We
then prepared some punch for ourselves and drank it. We
then went to an opposite end of the boats and held a consultation,
as to who was to make way with the old man, and it
fell to my lot to strike the fatal blow!</p>

<p>Oh, God! when I look back, it makes me shudder. Even
now it chills the blood in my veins.</p>

<p>It was understood that the deed was to be committed at
sunrise, precisely, provided there were no boats of any kind
near. By the time we had accomplished our consultation,
daylight was making its appearance in the east, and I cannot
here describe my feelings. Wages and McGrath discovered
my embarrassment, and resorted to another potion of hot
whiskey punch, which I drank freely. After I had drank, I
went into the old man’s cabin, armed with a small hatchet or
lathing axe. The old man was fast asleep, lying on his back;
I went up on deck and looked to the east, and saw that the
sun was just making his appearance; I returned to the little
cabin, raised the hatchet and struck the fatal blow in the centre
of the forehead, a little above the eyes. It made a full
dent in the skull the size of the hammer of the axe. He uttered
a kind of suppressed and strangled shriek and in a very few
minutes O’Connor was numbered among the dead.</p>

<p>Now the next business was to dispose of him. This, however
did not take us long, for we had some old cast iron grates,
that had belonged to a steamboat and which we used to set our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
cooking pots on. We took two of them and lashed them well
together, stripped off his clothing and left his body naked, and
tied a strong rope around his neck, and attached that to the
cast iron grates.</p>

<p>And oh! the awful scene that ensued! To see a fellow-being
who had been one of us so recently; to see his body cast to oblivion,
and his soul, then departed, to that “bourne from whence
no traveler returns.” Well, or not well it was, I may say.
Poor old O’Connor went down with about three hundred pounds
of iron attached to him—a little below Wolf Island, not far from
Mills’ Point.</p>

<p>We very soon passed New Madrid. On our way down the
Mississippi we had several calls of “What boat is that?”
“Where are you from?” to which we replied the “Non Such,”
and “Red Rover,” from “Independence, Mo.”</p>

<p>Our next business was to dispose of his clothing, his papers,
and to so disfigure the boats that they could not be identified.
So we took the same “hatchet,” and rubbed off “Non Such”
and “Red Rover,” and wrote in their place “Tip,” and “Tyler,”
which in those days took well. Thus rigged out, we glided on
gently and steadily; we had nothing to fear; we had two flatboats,
and they well loaded with produce, worth over five thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>To dispose of the boats and cargo was our next business, we
well knowing that other boats would be down from the same
river inquiring for O’Connor’s boats. We therefore lost no
time. We never stopped till we came to the mouth of Red
river, where we halted and warped into the mouth and tied up.
McGrath mounted his green goggles, blacked his hair and face,
so that I could not have known him, only that I was with him.
Wages took one of our skiffs and went to Tunica, where he took
a steamboat down to Welter’s. In a few days he and Welter
returned, and we were not long in closing a trade with him.
He gave us four thousand five hundred dollars in his note payable
the Fourth of July ensuing for our boats and cargo. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
boat was sent down the Atchafalya bayou, and the other down
the Mississippi to his residence.</p>

<p>Wages and Welter returned to Welter’s, and McGrath and I
remained to take care of the boats. A day or two after Welter
sent four of his “strikers” to take charge of the boats; and
after dividing the cargoes, one of them left down the river for
Welter’s with two of his men on board. We remained on the
other until we got an opportunity to have it towed into the
Atchafalya bayou, and we then made the best of our way down
the river to Welter’s, where we again joined Wages.</p>

<p>We there held a full consultation, and concluded to return to
the vicinity of Mobile, lie still for a while, collect and gather
up our money and secure it all at one place, where it could be
easily got if we should stand in need of it at any time. This
brought about the last of May, 1843. We went up to Natchez,
landed there, and steered our course through the country by
Liberty, Holmesville, Columbia, and on to Allen Brown’s, on
Red creek, in the southwest corner of Perry county, Miss.,
where Wages and I rested until about the last of June, when
we started on foot and walked to Pass Christian.</p>

<p>There we took a steamboat to New Orleans; from there up
the Mississippi to our old friend Welter’s to fulfill our
engagement with Harden on the Fourth of July. We arrived
there on the 2d of July, at night. Harden had been there some
day or two before us, dodging about rather concealed.</p>

<p>McGrath was either sick, or so feigned himself. We left
him at Brown’s, and in the neighborhood. Wages and I often
talked about the matter, and we came to the conclusion that he
was fearful of meeting some of his brother Methodists on some
of the steamboats, and had concluded to keep out of the way.
So Wages, Harden and I had a full conference relative to our
future course of operations, and came to a final conclusion, and
each made a short memorandum in his “diary” in our mystic
characters on the evening of the 3d of July.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fourth, Welter informed us that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
and his family had an invitation to partake of a “public dinner
and ball,” and that he would like to invite us, but was
afraid of the enquiries that would be made, of “who we were,”
“where we were from,” and “what was our occupation,” &amp;c. He
said, “there have been some enquiries about boat loads of
produce, and where I purchased so many negroes, and I think
we had better be more cautious for some time to come.” He
told us that he would furnish us a good dinner at his house
and plenty of wine and liquors of the best, and we might enjoy
ourselves until he returned next day. We accordingly
lived well that day and night. The old gentleman returned
with his family next day, about ten in the forenoon, and as he
said, much fatigued.</p>

<p>“Now, gentlemen,” said he, “the fourth of July is over; we
will to business, if you are ready;” to which we replied, “we
were like old souse, always ready!” “Now, your money is
ready for you in New Orleans,” says Welter, “and I will go
down on the first boat that passes. You must all take separate
boats; for,” said he, “the times are squally in this region; the
papers are full of rewards for those seven negroes, and there
is also a reward for three men, who are supposed to have killed
a flatboat man by the name of O’Connor; and if you three
travel together you will be sure to be arrested; I will go first
and have your money ready. Disguise yourselves as much
as possible, and meet me in our rendezvous in four nights
after to-night; and tell me what kind of money you want.”</p>

<p>Harden told him “Tennessee bank notes would suit him;”
Wages and I told him either Mobile Bank or Bank of Louisiana
would do us.</p>

<p>Just at this moment his waiter came to tell him there was a
boat in sight. He left immediately for the city. I tied up my
head, rubbed some ink around one eye, and put a green silk
patch over it, and took a boat the same evening; Harden the
next morning; and Wages the evening after. We had our appointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
boarding house, where we eat and slept in a private
room, where no person but our landlord ever saw us.</p>

<p>At the appointed time Welter met us, and paid us our money.
Harden his one thousand dollars and Wages and myself eight
hundred dollars in Mobile and New Orleans money. After paying
us all, he said: “Now, young men, let me advise you a
little. You have done a storming business in your line. You
have met with extreme success in everything you have undertaken,
and I do assure you that the glass pitcher, in going to
the fountain too often, will come back broken eventually; now
let me advise you each to return to your homes and friends,
collect and realise all your money and exchange it into gold
or silver coin, and have it ready for any emergency; keep yourselves
secluded as much as possible from the criticisms of the
community in which you reside, and the time will wear around
when you may turn loose again; but rest assured that I shall
have to withdraw all connection with you for the present; my
property is ample for the support of myself and family now,
and a liberal division among them after I am dead; I wish you
well, and hope you will act prudently for the future and not
run too great risks.” So saying he gave us each a hearty
shake of the hand, and bid us a final adieu. This was our last
interview with Welter. Since then we have not seen or heard
from him.</p>

<p>Our understanding with Harden was that he was to return to
the vicinity of Mobile in the fall or early in the winter. The
next morning early Harden, Wages and I paid our landlord and
left; Harden up the river to Tennessee, and Wages and I went
to the New Basin, took passage on a wood freighting schooner
to the Bay of St. Louis, and up Wolf river to a landing in the
piney woods. We had provided ourselves with some biscuit,
cheese and meat. We landed and walked to Allen Brown’s
again, where we landed the second night, very tired. McGrath,
when we returned, was over on Black creek at Daniel Smith’s,
hard up courting his daughter, Mary Smith, whom he married<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
the next June following. He soon got the word that Wages and
I had returned, and came over to Brown’s.</p>

<p>Now we were all easy, with plenty of time to feast and frolic.
We soon sent off to Pass Christian for flour, sugar, coffee, and
whiskey, too, tobacco, cigars, and other little nicknacks. We
first tried our hand at hunting deer and fishing in Red creek,
and did kill a few deer and caught some fish, but we found
that too fatiguing in that hot season, and we resorted to other
means to procure our fresh meat. And the way we slung old
Bill Griffin’s fine fat heifers and yearlings was a caution. Their
meat was very fat and remarkably fine flavored.</p>

<p>We remained at Brown’s and in the vicinity until after the
middle of August, and I don’t believe that old Brown and his
family had ever lived so well in his or their lives before. It
was then that Wages commenced courting old Brown’s daughter,
whom he afterward married; and it was then that Brown made
the proposition to Wages to go into the “counterfeiting business;”
and I am here compelled to say that the association of
Allen Brown with us was the main cause of our exposure, the
death of Wages and McGrath, and the annihilation of our clan,
and the prime cause of my fate.</p>

<p>Well, we rusticated at Brown’s our time out, and all of us
were fully satiated to our heart’s content, and now the time had
arrived for us to leave for our places near Mobile. A small
consultation as to the way of our departure was necessary, and
as McGrath was a member of the church, and had made frequent
visits to Brother Smith’s and Brother Bounds, he could
go publicly any way, and was to go by way of the back Bay of
Biloxi to visit the brethren about Evans’, while Wages and I
prepared ourselves with three days provisions, and started one
moonlight night—Brown with us, and two of his horses. He
went with us about thirty miles that night, and left us in the
morning and returned home. We lay-by that day near the
road, and started a little before sunset and crossed Pascagoula
at Fairley’s ferry before daylight next morning. We were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
then on our own native hills. We again laid by. The next
night we crossed Dog river at Ward’s bridge, and reached home
early in the morning. McGrath arrived about ten days after
us. Our first business was, after resting awhile, to gather all
our money and have a correct settlement and distribution of
our funds.</p>

<p>Now it was honor among thieves! I disgorged all into the
hands of Wages; he said to McGrath that he knew I had given
up all. “Now, McGrath,” said Wages, “shell out.” So McGrath
did turn out the seventeen hundred and twenty-five dollars.
Wages said to him “where is that gospel money?” to
which McGrath replied that the amount was small, and that he
thought he ought to retain that for pocket and spending money.
Wages then came out upon him in plain terms, and said: “McGrath,
you came in with us upon equal terms, and if you wish
to bulk or fly back, take your seventeen hundred dollars and
leave, but look out for the consequences!” McGrath soon
forked over about thirteen hundred dollars more. We had,
when properly estimated, thirty-one thousand eight hundred
and seventy-five dollars. This money was in joint stock between
us three, and a proper appropriation and distribution of
that sum was what we had next to look to.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Wages, “boys, we have this amount of money,
part in possession, and the balance at command. Let us devise
some plan to save it; this, however, you may reflect upon. Our
next business is to get the whole in possession; when we have
done that, our next business is to make the proper disposition
of it. So now we have buried at one place four thousand five
hundred dollars, and our deposits in bank in New Orleans six
thousand six hundred and seventy-five dollars, and what we
now have makes our account tally; our next business is to get
it altogether. When we have done that we must reflect well;
and,” said Wages to me, “James, I would rather that you and
McGrath would lie down and sleep until I have all that matter
accomplished, for I am fearful of your youthful imprudence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
and McGrath’s imprudent Irish brogue to go in blind right or
wrong, and always come out at the little end of the horn, as
they did at Vinegar Hill, or as Mitchell, Meagher and others
did in their recent effort in Ireland to obtain their liberty.” I
then proposed to McGrath to give Wages the whole and sole
control, to which he finally consented, though, I discovered,
with some reluctance.</p>

<p>“Now, boys,” said Wages, “I wish you to consider yourselves
upon the world until I return; and I enjoin on you not
to commit any unlawful act during the time it may take to realize
and gather together our money. For the certainty and
uncertainty of life we cannot account; we will therefore deposit
what money we have.” So we did—in the ground—and
each took fifty dollars for pocket money.</p>

<p>As the whole matter was now understood, McGrath returned
to the back Bay of Biloxi, to preaching and stealing, and I remained
in the vicinity of Mobile, pretending to burn and sell
charcoal; but in fact stealing and feeding a parcel of our loafing
and starving clan in Mobile, such as G. Cleveland, and
some others of less importance that I could name, but whose
names are not worth the pen, ink and paper it would take to
write them.</p>

<p>But I will now tell you all about this man G. Cleveland, so
far as I know him. When Wages, McGrath and I were in St.
Louis, we fell in with this fellow Cleveland. We had seen
him before in Cincinnati, but not to form an acquaintance. In
St. Louis he was all the time around us—he may have smelt
us out. He was then selling spurious money of “New York
North River Bank, Schommerhorn, president,” and several other
banks of this same stripe. He traveled then in considerable
style, with two large leather trunks, and they mostly packed
with this spurious money. His portmanteau contained a great
variety of “dickeys” and “collars,” and his natural appearance
and address always imposed upon a person unacquainted
with him. Wages then advised me not to have anything to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
with him, as he was a dangerous tool; and he so advised me
until the day of his death, but not taking Wages’ advice, Cleveland
and his concern got out of me some three hundred dollars,
with a faithful promise that I should be defended and
protected; that jail doors, grates or bars should not hold me;
but that they and their friends would burst asunder everything
for me. Now see where his pledge falls. He and his whole
concern will not flourish long. I have to suffer death solely
for the want of a proper effort being made by them. I now
leave Cleveland and the others to the mercy of their own conscience
and the censure of the world.</p>

<p>Now to our affairs. Wages had returned to New Orleans,
with all our money, and had purchased five barrels of whiskey,
in one of which he had placed all the money. He had procured
the whole of it in gold, and made a long, slim canvass
bag, which he could pass through the bung-hole of the barrel,
and in this bag he had placed his gold, mostly sovereigns, and
five and ten dollar pieces of American coin. After placing the
money in the barrel he put in the bung tight, and nailed on
the tin; shipped it as an ordinary barrel of whiskey, and
hauled it out to one of our camps, where we opened it, and
took out the gold. We had on hand a considerable amount of
bank notes of New Orleans and Mobile Banks. We then
agreed that Wages should take it all, and exchange it for gold,
under pretense of entering land for some company in Mississippi.
Wages took his little two-horse wagon, loaded with
pickets, and went to Mobile. The first trip he brought home
near eight thousand dollars in gold, which was deposited with
the rest. I then proposed to Wages and McGrath to make the
amount in gold, thirty thousand dollars even, and bury it in
some safe place, secure, so that we might have it for any
emergency; and in case of the death of one of us, the other
two were to share it; and if two died, one had all. So the
next trip Wages made to Mobile, he brought the balance to
make up the amount. We had three strong kegs made in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
Mobile, well iron-hooped, and we placed in each ten thousand
dollars; filled all the crevices with clean, white sand, headed
the kegs up, gave them three coats of paint, and after they
were thoroughly dry, we buried them in a thick swamp on
Hamilton’s Creek. The balance of our money we then divided
between us equally, which gave each share about six hundred
and twenty-five dollars.</p>

<p>To accomplish our settlement of affairs, brought about the
middle of November, 1843. McGrath left for the back Bay of
Biloxi, and I saw nothing more of him until after his marriage.</p>

<p>About two weeks after, Harden arrived at Wages’ riding a
very fine horse, and had with him a likely mulatto fellow, riding
on a very fine horse also, both of which he told me he sold
to a man by the name of Jenkins. The first object to be
effected was to kill and rob old man Sumrall. Mr. Newton
was to turn preacher and go to Mr. Sumrall’s house, and by
some means effect the object; but by some misstep his intention
was discovered through one of the house servants, the
alarm was given, and brother Newton was ordered to leave
brother Sumrall’s premises. Wages and I lay in ambush, and
had our appointed places to meet. We soon learned the result
of Harden’s adventure at Sumrall’s. I returned to Mobile,
Harden went to Louisiana, and Wages, by Jasper county, to
Mobile. We were all to meet again about the last of February,
on Black Creek, at the Pearlington road. We did meet, and a
very few days after old Robert Lott was killed and all his
money taken. This was sometime early in March, 1844.
Wages was with Harden that night, and helped; I did not
happen there. I met Wages next morning, at our camp, and
he told me what was done, and turned me back. Harden and
Wages had divided a little over two thousand dollars. Harden
left a few nights after for the Mississippi swamp in Louisiana,
and Wages and I for Mobile, and traveled altogether in
the night, to avoid discovery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>


<h3 id="MEETING_OF_THE_CLAN">MEETING OF THE CLAN IN MOBILE, ALABAMA.</h3>

<p>After we got to Mobile and had rested ourselves, there were
several complaints made to Wages and I, about the derangement
of the affairs of the clan. They had, during our absence,
elected a president <i lang="la">pro tem.</i> Wages went round and called a
meeting at the Wigwam. There was a crowded meeting, but
they were mostly new members, who were very noisy. Wages
then told them the object of the meeting; that it was to inquire
into the situation of the clan; that his long absence had prevented
him from attending any meeting for over two years; it
was necessary to inquire into the affairs, and a system of action
must be preserved in all institutions. Some of the new
members were very clamorous and wanted to make a break
and a raise at something; they had no money and must have
some, and all such stuff. Wages then reminded them that we
had a Vigilant Committee, who at all times had the control and
power to report, and upon their report the clan would act. He
also reminded them of their obligation and the terms upon
which they came into the clan, and for any breach or exposure
their life would pay the forfeit. He then announced to the
meeting that he would hold an adjourned meeting that night
two weeks, for the purpose of having the minutes made up,
and a full report from the Vigilant Committee; but, before the
time arrived, Wages was informed that four of these members
had come in as spies, and that we had traitors in the ranks.
He then advised me of the fact, and we agreed to withdraw.
We never visited the Wigwam again; but we formed a new and
select one among a few of us, and among the new clan were
four of my brothers—Isham, nicknamed Whin, Henry, John
and Thomas Copeland, Jefferson Baker and Joshua Walters, all
men of bravery.</p>

<p>Our next business was to dispose of all spies and traitors,
and it was not long before four of them butted their heads
against a slung-shot hung to a man’s arm, and they went floating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
from Mobile wharf down the channel of the river. Old
Palmer, one of our clan, near Springhill, met up with my
brother Whin and I: he had made some exposures of our
affairs. Our two rifles made clear fire, and we left him in a
situation where he told no more tales. Sometime after, Tom
Powell, another of the clan, made some threats that he intended
to drive the Copelands out of the country. McGrath
and I waylaid him and fed him with the contents of two double-barrel
shot-guns, about forty-eight buck-shot, and put him in
a swamp near Eslaya’s old mill. Another of the clan, Jim
Harper, attempted to betray us by decoying us into the hands
of some of our enemies; Wages, McGrath and I managed to
catch him. We took him into an old house near the old Stage
Stand. We then put a rope around his neck, and we very soon
squeezed the breath out of him. We stripped off his clothes,
and left him in the old house, a prey to the buzzards; took all
the clothes some distance off and piled lightwood knots on
them, and burnt them.</p>

<p>Sometime after McGrath was married, Wages went over into
Mississippi, about old Brown’s, and sometimes down about
Honey Island, near Gainesville, and remained there from the
summer of 1843 until the fall of 1844, during which time I
had seen him but twice, when he came over to his father’s on a
visit, in the fall of 1844. Wages and McGrath came over to
the vicinity of Mobile and sent for me, and then informed me
of the plan they were about to pursue. That they were going
to commence making counterfeit money: that they had procured
a man who could engrave their dies, and another who
was a professed chemist and could prepare the metal so well
that it would take a very acute judge to detect it. I told
Wages that whatever he went at I was in; “but,” said I, “I
feel somewhat fearful.” “Oh,” said they, “we have made a
large acquisition to our clan, we now have Jim McArthur,
Jack McArthur, Allen Brown, Daniel Brown, Jim Bilbo and
Wash Bilbo. We are to settle McGrath at Honey Island;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
Wages at Catahoula; Allen Brown at Red Breek, and the Bilbos
and McArthurs are to range from Pearl River to Pascagoula;
and,” said they, “your party can range from Mobile to Pascagoula,
and you can pass horses or negroes from Georgia to
Florida on this route through to Louisiana, without discovery,
and so from Louisiana in the same way.” I then told Wages
and McGrath both, that I was still afraid of their new acquisition.
I then proposed to them to remove our money from
Hamilton’s Creek, and place it somewhere near where Wages
was going to settle. I made this proposition because I believed
that this counterfeiting business would be the means of
getting us into trouble, and that we could procure our money
more easily from that vicinity than we could where it was.</p>

<p>I had then arrived at the age of majority and began to have
a more reflecting mind, and I never did have any reliance or
confidence in that money arrangement. Wages then informed
me that he was engaged to marry Allen Brown’s daughter, but
did not know what time; it might be a year before he did so.
“McGrath,” said he, “is now married, and will move to Honey
Island shortly; I shall be engaged in preparing our shop and
arranging the materials, and making preparations for the settlement
of my home.”</p>

<p>They then told me that Niel McIntosh, would also be one of
our clan, and that he would travel to and from Mobile to our
other places, as a spy, and look out for us. They left the next
day for Mississippi, and I saw nothing more of either of them
for over twelve months. Niel McIntosh made several trips
over and back, and always had plenty of their money, but I was
always afraid of it. He passed a considerable amount in the
vicinity of Mobile, and made something by it.</p>

<p>John Harden brought three or four fine horses, one, he said,
from Florida and the others from Georgia; I advanced him the
money and passed them on to Wages, who sold them for me.
S. Harden made two trips to the vicinity of Mobile that year,
one from North Alabama, and one from western North Carolina:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
The first trip he brought two good horses and a likely
negro boy. I assisted him to sell the horses near Fort Stoddart,
for a fine price, to some men going to Texas. I then
furnished him two ponies and sent McIntosh to pilot him
through to Wages, who paid him for his negro and sent him to
Pearlington, where he again embarked for Tennessee, by way
of New Orleans.</p>

<p>About four months afterwards Harden returned again. He
had two splendid horses, fine traveling equipage, and a likely
mulatto girl about sixteen years old, dressed in boys clothes,
traveling with him as his waiter. He said he had traveled
through Georgia and Eastern Alabama to Blakely, and crossed
the Bay over to Mobile, and came out to our place. He told
us he feared no pursuit; that he had traveled too far, that
there was no danger. I assisted him in selling the two horses,
in Mobile, and saw them often afterwards. They were fine
buggy horses. The girl he sold to a man in Mobile, who kept
her as a wife, and she now passes for free. He had stolen her
from a rich old widow lady in North Carolina, who had sent
the girl on an errand, on a Saturday morning, some twenty-five
miles on the same fine horse, to return on Sunday evening,
and she never did return.</p>

<p>In these two trips of Harden’s he gave me five hundred dollars
for my assistance. I then assisted him to steal a very fine
horse on the Tombigbee River, for which he gave me fifty dollars
more, and left for Tennessee. This had pretty well consumed
the fall of 1845.</p>

<p>In December, Wages came home to his father’s; sent for me;
told me that he was going to get married shortly, and invited
me to his wedding; I promised him I would go if my business
did not prevent me; but it so turned out that he did marry a
short time after, and I was not present. After his marriage,
he brought his wife to see his father and mother, and spent
some weeks with them. He had with him plenty of counterfeit
coin, and wanted me to take some and pass for him. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
I refused to do, and I then advised him that it would be better
for us all to let that alone; and then reminded him that when
there was none but him, McGrath and I together, that we
could get along to better advantage, do a more profitable business
and had a wider field to operate in. But he seemed to
think that they could manage to get along; and I found from
his conversation that old Allen Brown had got control of him,
and I said no more on the subject. I told him frankly that
their money I would have nothing to do with; but in other
matters of stealing and selling horses, negroes and cattle, I
would take a hand as heretofore, to which he assented, and
here we dropped the subject for the present. I again urged
upon him the removal of our money. I dreaded an outbreak,
for I then believed that old Brown would blow the whole matter;
and sure enough he afterwards did.</p>

<p>So Wages and his wife left, and went back to Mississippi, to
old Brown, and he went to work building his house on Catahoula,
in Hancock County. He got it completed; moved
into it; took his horse; came again to Mobile; procured his
father’s two horse wagon to haul some articles for house-keeping
from Mobile, and on his way back I went with him, the
first night, and we camped near where our money was buried.
We went and got the three kegs; placed them in the bottom of
his wagon, covered them with hay and placed the balance of
his load on them. He hauled them out to Hancock county,
and deposited them in Catahoula Swamp, about a mile and a
half or two miles from his house, and designated the place by a
large pine tree that grew at the margin of the swamp, to the
north-east, and about thirty-five yards from where the kegs
were deposited, and a magnolia tree that grew about ten yards
to the south-west. He gave me a diagram of the place, the
courses, and distances which he had measured accurately,
marked in lines and explained in our mystic key. That paper
I somehow lost in the famous Harvey battle.</p>

<p>So it was Wages left and went to his place. Now he and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
his crowd were for themselves, and me and my crowd for ourselves.
My crowd consisted of myself, and four brothers, Josh
Walters, Jef. Baker and old McIntosh, our outside striker, to
run stolen horses or a negro, when required. Our range was
from Mobile to Pascagoula, and from the Sea Coast to St.
Stephen’s. We fed ourselves and families upon pork, beef
and mutton, in abundance, and we sold enough in the market
to pay us from fifty to one hundred dollars per month—sometimes
ready butchered and sometimes on foot, during the summer
and fall season. Those we sold the meat of, we generally
stole in the vicinity of Mobile. Old man Wages had a farm
on Big Creek Swamp, about twenty-five miles from Mobile, in
rather an obscure place. That was our place of resort and deposit,
and many a stolen beef and horse has been concealed
there until we could dispose of them.</p>

<p>We continued that business during 1845, 1846, and until the
summer of 1847. We had stolen a small drove of cattle out
near Chickasahay, and in driving them we gathered a few
head near Mobile, belonging to old Moses Copeland. We sold
the cattle to Bedo Baptiste, who paid my brother Henry and I
for them. We claimed them; Whinn, or Isham and John
helped to drive, but received none of the money. My brothers
Henry and John, and Isham or Whinn, were arrested and tried.
Henry was convicted of the larceny and served two years in
the penitentiary of Alabama. Whinn and John were acquitted;
I took to the bushes. They did not catch me that hunt, and I
lay in the woods and was concealed among my clan the balance
of that summer, most of the time at old Wages’, on Big
Creek, waiting for Gale Wages to come so as to make a settlement
with him, and to close my business and leave the country.</p>

<p>The time passed on slowly. I stopped all further operations
until I could hear from Wages and McGrath, and, lo! some
time late in the fall up rolled Wages and old Brown, and sure
enough old Brown, as I had anticipated and expected, had
blown the whole concern. He had gone into the little town of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
Gainesville and passed a few dollars of their money for some
small articles of trade, where the old fool might have known he
would be detected; and sure enough he was. Now the next
step was for him to get out of the difficulty, and when asked
where he got the money, he said “from Bilbos.” They were
arrested and brought up, and he swore it on to them, and they
had to give bail to answer the charge of passing counterfeit
money.</p>

<p>Bilbos then swore vengeance against Brown and Wages, who
had pulled up stakes and were leaving Hancock county, and
Mississippi, too. The Bilbos pursued them, and passed them
some way; turned back, and the parties met suddenly on a small
hill. While one party ascended on one side the other party
ascended on the other side, and both parties were within a few
paces of each other at first view. Wages had the advantage of
them; he had his double barrel gun well loaded and fresh caps
on; Bilbos had their rifles well loaded and fresh primed, but
they had a rag over the powder in the pan to keep it dry. These
rags they had to remove before they could fire. Wages immediately
fired and killed one of them dead, and then fired at
the other before he could get ready to shoot and broke his
thigh. From some cause Bilbo’s horse got scared and threw
him to the ground, and he immediately begged for his life. At
first sight of the Bilbos old Brown ran, so Wages said.</p>

<p>Now it was that Wages and Brown both had to make their
escape the best way they could. They came to Mobile, and
there they were on the scout, as well as myself. McGrath was
so well identified with them that he was watched very closely
about Gainesville. He got into some corn stealing scrape, and
broke into Hancock jail, and nothing but the gold or silver
key ever turned him out. He and Wages happened to have
a little of that, and he and his wife then left Honey Island, and
were at Daniel Smith’s, on Black creek, in Perry county. So
it was Brown and Wages managed to get their families, and
McGrath and his wife back into the vicinity of Mobile some
time in November, 1847.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>Wages and McGrath had very near got through with all
their money. McGrath, in particular, had none, only as he
borrowed. Wages had some, but had spent a large amount in
feeding and clothing old Brown and his gang. Wages and his
wife remained on Big creek at the old man’s place, and I the
greater part of the time with him. Brown and McGrath moved
down on Dog river, near Stage Stand, pretending to burn coal
and cut wood to sell, but they were in fact stealing, for they
had nothing to eat and but little money. Brown had sold his
possessions in Perry county to Harvey, and had received all his
pay but forty dollars. He had represented his land to be saved
or entered land, when it was public land, and Harvey refused
to pay the forty dollar note, and that same pitiful note, and
Brown’s rascality and falsehood cost Wages and McGrath their
lives, and Harvey and Pool their lives, and have placed me
where I am.</p>

<p>Wages and I while on Big creek held a consultation as to our
future course. Wages then sorely repented any connection that
he ever had with old Brown, “and,” said he, “I intend to get
away from him, for I am fearful the old fool will get drunk and
tell everything he does know.” We then concluded our best
way was for Wages to take his horse and cart, take old Niel
McIntosh with him, and his wife and child, and start west and
travel in the vicinity of Pearl river; there leave his wife; take
the cart and horse and he and McIntosh to travel down Pearl
river till they came opposite Catahoula; then turn in and get
our money, and cross the Mississippi river; send McIntosh
back to let McGrath and I know where to find him, and for us
to slip off and go slyly, and not let Brown know where we were
going, “and,” said Wages, “if I can manage to rob old Tom
Sumrall on my route and make a raise, so much the better.
And you and your crowd may manage to make a raise here before
you leave.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>


<h3 id="BURNING_OF_ELI">BURNING OF ELI MAFFITT’S HOUSE, AND ATTEMPTED MURDER OF
HIS WIFE.</h3>

<p>The same day Wages and I were consulting thus, my brother
John Copeland came to bring me some clothes, and he informed
me that it was reported that old Eli Maffitt held a large amount
of money, and that there was a project on foot to rob him and
burn his house the first good opportunity; that Maffitt had
taken a contract to build a bridge in Perry county, and would
shortly leave home, and that Eli Myrick was to let the party
know what time Maffitt commenced the bridge and would be
absent from home. I then told Wages what was on foot. He
then said “let me leave home about three days before, and I
will try on the some night to rob old Sumrall and burn his
house.” In a few days Myrick came down and told us that
Maffitt was up in Perry county, and would not be home in two
weeks. Wages immediately geared up, and started with his
cart, his wife and McIntosh. Three nights after that Allen
Brown, McGrath, John Copeland and I went to Maffitt’s just
after dark, about seven o’clock, on the night of the 15th of December,
1847. Eli Myrick did not go with us, because he said
Mrs. Maffitt would know him too well, but he was in the secret
and shared his part of the money.</p>

<p>On getting near, we stopped to consult as to the safest way
to get the money. Some were for robbing the house and not
injuring any of the family. That I opposed, for I never believed
in leaving any living witness behind to tell what I had done, if
there was any way to prevent it. I always thought that two
persons were enough to keep a secret, and it was safest if one
of them were dead, for dead witnesses give no evidence. It
was agreed that we should go into the house and demand the
money, and if given up, to leave the inmates peaceably and unharmed.</p>

<p>John and I went in with a very stern look, thinking we could
frighten the old lady, and make her give up every dollar that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
was in the house. But we were as sternly and peremptorily
refused. The old lady said that she knew nothing about the
money, and if she did, that we would not get it; we then told
her that we had come after money and that money we would
have before we left that house, or her life; and she still bravely
defied us. John Copeland had in his hand a large hickory
stick and I had another. Perceiving that she was determined,
and our only chance to get the money was to kill her, while
the old lady and I were quarreling about the money, I gave my
brother John the wink, and he struck her a blow on the head
which felled her to the floor. He repeated the blows, and I
hit her several blows. We were then certain that we had killed
her. We then commenced plundering the house, in search of
the money; and we ransacked the whole house from top to
bottom, but the amount we did find was small. I do not remember
the precise amount we got, but it did not exceed two
hundred dollars, and to our great displeasure we afterwards
found out, that there was a large amount of gold and silver in
the house at the time, that we did not find.</p>

<p>After we had plundered the house to our satisfaction, of all
the money we could find, and each one of us had his load of
the most valuable articles about, we set the house on fire and
burnt everything up, together as we thought with Mrs. Maffitt
who we thought was dead, and we left with a full conviction
in our own minds that she would be burnt in the house. When
I afterwards learned that she was not dead, I often wondered
at her providential escape.</p>

<p>The gold and silver we had overlooked, was all melted, and
I understood that Maffitt afterwards took it to Mobile and
disposed of it.</p>

<p>Wages, in his adventure, was not so successful as we were.
On the same night, he and McIntosh camped near Tallahala,
not far from old Sumrall’s and in the vicinity of Bryant Barlow’s.
Barlow happened to pass their camp early in the night
and discovered Wages. He raised a company and got after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
Wages, themselves and dogs, and Wages had to leave and take
the woods for home again. McIntosh and Wages’ wife turned
back for Mobile on the Big Creek place, where they all landed
about five days after. There we were all in the vicinity of Mobile
again; Wages had made a water haul and we had done
worse. Wages was laying out, Brown and myself were in the
same situation. It became necessary for Wages, McGrath
and I to hold a private consultation, relative to our future
operations, and to devise some plan to get rid of old Brown.
We could see no way to do that, unless it would be to lie to him
and frighten him to leave, which we did. Our next plan was to
manage to get our money from Catahoula, and deposit it about the
Bay of St. Louis, near the sea coast, where we could get it on a
boat. Wages and McGrath were to attend to that matter, and
I was to assist Brown over the Mississippi. So Wages went to
Brown and told him that there was a reward for both of them,
and said he, “I am going to leave, and you had better do the
same, for Maffitt has a crowd now on the look out for us.”
Brown had but little money. He then enjoined it upon Wages
to take Harvey’s note and give him the money for it. Said he,
“if he won’t pay the note you and McGrath kill the d——d
rascal.” So saying, Wages gave him the money for the note,
and loaned him sixty dollars more, and then told Brown that
James Copeland would go with him and assist his family to
travel, while he, Brown, could dodge before and behind. So
the matter was understood, and in a few nights Brown rolled
off and crossed Dog River at Ward’s bridge, where Wages, McGrath
and I joined him; I took charge of the teams and family,
and Brown took his rifle and to the woods, mostly in the daytime.
We did not want for fresh meat; Wages and McGrath
left for Catahoula by way of Harvey’s, and crossed at Fairley’s;
we crossed at Robert’s and old Green court house, and
up Black Creek, on by Columbia, Holmesville and so on to the
mouth of Red River. After crossing the Mississippi, I loaned
old Brown twenty-five dollars more, bid him good-by and returned
to the vicinity of Mobile. I was gone over four weeks.</p>

<h3 id="WAGES_AND_MGRATH_KILLED">WAGES AND M’GRATH KILLED BY HARVEY.</h3>

<p>On my way back I learned at Black Creek, of the death of
Wages and McGrath. They had got into some difficulty with
Harvey about the forty dollar note, and he shot and killed them
both. This news sounded in my ears like thunder; and so astounded
was I that I lost for the time all my senses. However,
after a little reflection, I began to think over my situation,
and a thousand thoughts hurled through my brain. Almost
instantly, it seemed that every crime I had ever committed
in my life was then pictured before my eyes and the awful
consequences attending them. The object, for which I committed
them, was money; and it was now doubtful whether I
should ever obtain that, or not. Upon further reflection, I
recollected that Wages had given me a diagram or map of the
place where our, now my money was hidden, and a direction
of the course so that I certainly could find it. Stimulated with
the idea of being worth thirty thousand dollars, I began to
cheer up and returned home.</p>


<h3>REWARD OF ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS OFFERED FOR HARVEY’S
SCALP.</h3>

<p>The first thing was to procure my map or diagram, which I
did. I found all my friends grieving. The first word asked
me by old man Wages and the old lady was: “What are you
going to do, James? Are you not going to seek vengeance on
that Harvey?” Both then said to me, “James we will give you
one thousand dollars for Harvey’s scalp, if you will kill the
rascal or have it done.” I then told them I would see some
of my friends, and let them know in a short time.</p>

<p>A short time after that I received a notice to attend a meeting
of the clan, at our Wigwam in the city, on a certain night.
So I disguised myself and went into the city and attended, and
in that meeting I met several officers of the city, such as constables,
deputy sheriff, etc., who all told me not to be afraid;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
that there would be no exertion to arrest me. There were a
number of resolutions passed commemorative of the demise of
our departed friends and brothers Gale H. Wages and Charles
McGrath. After the adoption of these resolutions, I then raised
the question before the meeting as to the propriety of taking
up with old Wages’ offer; and after explaining that offer to
the meeting, it was unanimously approved; and I was nominated
to head and lead the band on that expedition, with power
to select as many, and just such men of our clan as I thought
necessary. So I selected Jackson Pool, Sam. Stoughton, John
Copeland and Thomas Copeland. I selected them because
they were good woodsmen, and I knew that Pool and Stoughton
were brave.</p>

<p>After I had made the selection, I called them all together
and we held a consultation. It was agreed that we would go
and make the trial on Harvey; but that we must have five hundred
dollars from old Wages in advance. I went to old Wages,
and told him what was our conclusion. He hesitated at first,
and offered to give us security that the money should be paid
when we had done the job; I told him, “no! it was a dangerous
undertaking, and we must be paid something to start with.”
Finally, after consulting with his wife, he agreed to give us the
five hundred dollars. Our only business then was to prepare
ourselves with the best of double-barrel guns and pistols and
bowie knives, with plenty of ammunition and percussion caps
of the best quality, and thus armed and equipped we were
ready for our journey.</p>

<p>Now I had a two fold object in view; that was, to go on to
Catahoula, and search for my money, and for that purpose I
took with me my diagram or map. The old man forked over
the five hundred dollars, and we made ready for the start.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning the 8th day of July, 1848, we all set out
from Wages’ place on Big Creek, where we had assembled for
that purpose. We had not traveled far before Thomas Copeland
was taken sick and turned back, at Dog River. We then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
traveled on by Fairley’s ferry, the O’Neal settlement and by
James Batson’s to Harvey’s place. We traveled leisurely and
camped out every night. We did not stop at any house after
we left Pascagoula, and we reached Harvey’s place early in the
day on the Saturday following. I was well acquainted with
the place for I had been there with Wages and McGrath when
Allen Brown lived there.</p>

<p>We found the house empty, but from appearances we judged
that the farm was cultivated. We saw signs of foot steps
about the house and yard, from which we inferred that Harvey
was in the habit of coming about there daily. Our next
business was to prepare for action. We went into the house
and made many port holes on every side, so that we could
shoot Harvey, let him approach which ever side he would.
Our next business was to examine around the premises for his
path, and place a sentinel there in ambush for his arrival.
This sentinel was cautiously relieved every two or three hours,
whilst the balance of us remained close inside or about the
house, eating figs, peaches and water melons and destroying
more than we eat.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we began to get hungry; I proposed to the
balance to go over to Daniel Brown’s, about a mile and get
some bread and meat for us all. Pool and Stoughton objected,
and said, “there is plenty of green corn in the field; let us
make a fire and roast some of the ears and eat here.” I then
objected, and told them that if Harvey discovered a smoke in
the house he would take the hint, and give the alarm, and that
we should have the whole of Black and Red Creek down upon
us. They still persisted, and Stoughton went into the field,
gathered about twenty ears of the best and greenest corn and
brought them into the house. Pool went out and brought in
a load of wood and made a large fire and they roasted their
corn.</p>

<p>That was precisely what betrayed us—the smoke issuing
from the chimney of the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>After the corn was roasted, we all eat heartily; John Copeland
was on guard; Pool took his place, and John came in and eat.
A little before sunset it was Stoughton’s time to relieve Pool.
My brother John proposed to Stoughton to let him relieve
Pool, and for Stoughton to take the next watch around the
house. So it was agreed, and Pool came to the house.</p>


<h3>PRESENTIMENT OF POOL’S DEATH.</h3>

<p>Awhile after sunset, Stoughton, Pool and I were sitting on
the gallery, talking very low, about the way we should have to
manage. We were fearful Harvey was not at home, or had left
the country. Some of us were eating figs and some eating
peaches. All of a sudden our attention was arrested by a large
white fowl, which passed through the yard some fifteen or
twenty yards from us. It was a kind of fowl that I had never
seen before, nor had either of my comrades, as they asserted.
It walked some ten or fifteen yards; we rose to get a more
minute view, and it took flight and ascended, until we lost
sight of it in the distance. This seemed to strike Pool with
terror and amazement, and he reflected a few minutes and said,
“Boys, I shall be a dead man before to-morrow night! That
is an omen of my death!”</p>

<p>Stoughton laughed and said to Pool, that if he was a dead
man he would make a very noisy corpse; but Pool still insisted
that it was a signal of his death, and urged hard that we
should leave that place, and retire to one more secluded. “I
did wrong,” said he, “in making fire in the house.” We tried
to laugh him out of his predictions, but all to no purpose; and
sure enough, as he had conjectured, before the next night he
was a corpse.</p>

<figure class="figcenter width800 illowp80" id="facing103_2">
  <img class="w100" src="images/facing103.jpg" alt="Gunmen attack Copeland and his gang in their cabin.">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">The Famous Harvey Battle.</span>—[See <a href="#Page_103">page 103</a>.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Just before dark, Stoughton went to where brother John was
stationed, and they both remained until after dark; they then
came up to the house, and Stoughton mounted guard. All
this time Pool appeared to be in a deep study and had nothing
to say, appeared dejected and low spirited. We all laid down,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
except Stoughton, to try to sleep; I could see Pool and John;
they could not sleep. The moon rose two or three hours before
day, and I got into a doze several times and each time the most
huge serpents would be after me, that I ever beheld. This
would waken me, and finally I got up and walked about; I
found Pool was up. Stoughton said he could not sleep, and
brother John got up and said he could not sleep. We then consulted
together and Pool was for leaving the place before
day. Stoughton objected, and said, “Let’s wait until eight or
nine o’clock in the morning; after Harvey gets his breakfast he
may come to the orchard for fruit. If he does not come by
this time, we may leave.”</p>

<p>Daylight made its appearance not long after that, and shortly
after the sun rose, and poor Pool said after the sun had
risen above the horizon: “How beautiful the sun looks this
morning; the sky looks so pure, clear and serene!” Poor
fellow! It was the last sun that he ever beheld encircling this
earth.</p>


<h3 id="THE_FAMOUS_HARVEY_BATTLE">THE FAMOUS HARVEY BATTLE.</h3>

<p>The time passed on until between eight or nine o’clock.
We were all out in the yard, eating figs and peaches; John
Copeland all at once cried out: “Boys, there comes a young
army of Black Creek men!” We all dodged into the house.
Pool seized his gun, and says, “boys take your guns!” I said to
him, “they will not trouble us; they are a company out hunting,
and are coming in here for figs and water melons and other
fruit; they are not in pursuit of us!” “Yes they are,” said
Pool, “and I will sell my life as dear as I can!” So saying he
cocked both barrels of his gun and pistol and eased his bowie
knife in the sheath.</p>

<p>We had given no instructions, only to be silent and remain
still. They seemed to separate and go in different directions.
On coming near the house, some one of their company hailed
to the balance, “come on, boys, here they are!” “There!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
said Pool, “I told you so.” So soon as we heard this, we knew
that we had been discovered, and that it was to kill or be
killed.</p>

<p>I made my escape out of the house the first opportunity I
saw, dodged around a big fig tree, and looked back a moment
at the house. Pool was standing in the door with his gun at
a poise. Harvey came round the corner of the house, on
Pool’s right, and jumped into the gallery; Pool immediately
fired, and struck Harvey in the left side. Harvey immediately
squared himself and shot the contents of his whole load in
Pool’s side, and fell on the gallery. Pool stepped into the
yard, and another man shot him in the breast, and he immediately
fell dead.</p>

<p>At this moment Stoughton and John Copeland jumped out
of the door and ran; I wheeled immediately as the crowd
rushed around the house, and ran. At the report of the next
gun, the shot whistled all around my head, I then heard several
guns. It appeared to me there must have been five hundred
at that moment; and I have no doubt that I made the
best running there that I ever made in my life before. In fact,
it seemed to me that it was no trouble, that I never touched
the ground, but flew over it.</p>

<p>After I had got a sufficient distance from the place, and found
I was not pursued by any of their party, I stopped to reflect to
myself, and wondered what had become of Stoughton and my
bother John. Pool, I knew, must be dead, for I saw him fall,
and the blood gush from the wound. I felt almost certain that
Stoughton and my brother John were both killed also, from the
number of guns I heard fired, as I thought.</p>

<p>It was then that I more seriously meditated on my situation
than I ever had done before, and wondered to myself what I
should do for the best. I felt very sad, and thanked my God
for my providential escape, believing that all the rest of my
comrades were in eternity. But after I had thus meditated
and reflected upon the past, I felt that I deserved death, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
all my crimes again stared me full in the face. I then formed
a stern resolution within my own breast, that if God would
permit me ever again to reach my home, that I would refrain
from all my evil ways, and become a Christian, believing that
God had been merciful to me, in preserving me, and hurling
my comrades and associates into another world.</p>

<p>After a while I became more collected and concluded I would
go over to Daniel Brown’s, who, I knew, did not live far from
that place. I had been there but a short time when my brother
John came up, bare-headed, and mud above his knees, where he
had run through a muddy reed-brake. He called me to one
side, and in a few words he told me that Stoughton was not
killed, but Pool was, and that our enemies had left there. He
saw them carrying Harvey away, and he thought Harvey was
dead; that we had better go over and do something with Pool
and get Stoughton, and leave.</p>

<p>This was on Sunday, the 15th of July, 1848. Several persons
had accidently happened in at Brown’s that day. I went
into the house and told the company what had happened over
to the other house, since I left; that there had been some
shooting done, and that Pool was killed, and I expected Harvey
was; that we were on our way to Honey Island, and
stopped there for the night; and that I had come over to
Brown’s to get some bread baked, and that it had all occurred
since I left; and that I would like to go over and do something
with Pool, and see if Stoughton was killed. A number of persons
went with us to the place, some ladies among the rest.
When we got there we found Pool lying dead. We laid him
straight on his back. I recollected that he had some money,
and I soon sounded his pockets, and obtained one hundred
and twenty dollars of the money I had given him. There was
a five dollar gold piece missing. I took all he had. As he
had other means, I knew that the money would do him no
good then. I went into the house and got John Copeland’s
hat, and went down to the side of the swamp and called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
Stoughton, and he came out. We were then all together again,
except Pool.</p>

<p>We gathered our guns, returned to Brown’s, eat dinner, and
left for home. But in the affray I had lost my memorandum
book, and in that book was the diagram or map and directions
where to find the money which belonged to Wages, McGrath
and myself; I hunted for it diligently, but could not find it.
It certainly went in a very mysterious way, and I have often
since thought that the decree of Justice forbid me enjoying
that money.</p>

<p>After we left Brown’s that day, we traveled on the same
route we had come. We slept in the woods that night, and
next day we got something to eat at Peter Fairley’s, and so
continued our journey on home, where we arrived on Sunday,
the 22d of July, having been gone just fourteen days. When
we arrived, old Wages was highly pleased that Harvey was
killed, and he and the old lady very promptly settled with us.
He paid us off with his place on Big Creek, in part, and the
balance in hogs, cattle, pony horses, carts and farming tools
and utensils. My father and mother, with the family, removed
to the place.</p>

<p>In a very little while after that, the times began to be very
squally. Old Wages and his wife had to pull up stakes, take
their negroes and leave the country, at a great sacrifice of their
property. I was already an outlaw; my brother John now became
one with me. Stoughton, like a fool, as he was, took a
yoke of oxen, or some cattle, which he had received from Wages
in part pay for his services, to Mobile for sale. While there,
he was arrested and put in jail, under the requisition of the
Governor of Mississippi, and conveyed from Mobile to Perry
county, where he was tried and convicted twice. The first
conviction was reversed by the Appellate Court, and while in
prison, waiting a second hearing, he died. So went another
of our clan to eternity.</p>

<p>I still continued laying out and hiding myself from place to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
place, fully intending to leave the country just as soon as I
could settle my business; and I even made several appointments
of times that I would go, but some way, or somehow,
there appeared to be a supernatural power which controlled my
every action, and I could not leave the vicinity of Mobile.</p>

<p>During that fall and winter my brother John and I made
two trips from Big Creek to Catahoula to hunt for that money,
and the last trip we made I was prepared to leave. Brother
John had left the principal part of his money at home, and had
to go back after it, and he prevailed on me to go with him. We
returned to the vicinity of Mobile, where I loitered away my
time for some month or two, and it seemed that my mind in
some way became confused and impaired, and I took to drinking
too much spiritous liquors. One day, some time in the
spring of 1849, my brothers John, Thomas, Isham or Whinn,
and I were at a little grocery store near Dog river, about twelve
miles from Mobile. I drank too much spirits and became intoxicated,
and in that situation I imagined every man I saw
was trying to arrest me. I fell in with a man by the name of
Smith, an Irishman, and a difficulty occurred between us; I
concluded that he intended to arrest me. I drew my double-barrel
shot gun upon him and intended to kill him. He was
too quick for me; he threw up my gun, drew his dirk and
stabbed me just above the collar bone. The wound did not
quite penetrate the cavity of the chest, or it would have killed
me; I threw down my gun and ran about two hundred yards and
fainted. My brothers then carried me about two miles, and one
of them went home and got a carriage and took me home. Smith
went to Mobile and told the news. A party came out and
tracked me up by the blood, and arrested and carried me to
Mobile jail.</p>

<p>I was now in the worst situation I ever was in in my life.
One indictment against me in Alabama for larceny, and another
against me in Mississippi for murder, and the requisition of
the Governor of Mississippi then in the hands of the officer to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
carry me there to be tried. The question was which trial to
avoid; if found guilty, as I felt certain I would be, in both
cases, one would be the penitentiary for not less than four
years, and the other would be hanging. I employed the best
counsel that could be procured in Mobile, and on consulting
with him and making him fully acquainted with all the facts, he
advised me to plead guilty of the larceny and go to the penitentiary
of Alabama; “for,” said he, “you may stand some
chance after your four years are out to make your escape from
the clutches of the law in Mississippi. They may not think to
file their requisition with the Governor of Alabama in time,
and in that event, when your time expires, you will be let
loose.”</p>

<p>My trial came on before my wound was near well, and I was
brought into court and arraigned, and the indictment read to
me in open court. When asked “are you guilty or not guilty?”
I plead guilty, after which my counsel addressed the court and
prayed its indulgence in passing sentence, and that the term
of punishment be made as short as the law would permit, which
was accordingly done, and sentence of four years at hard labor
in the penitentiary of Alabama was passed upon me.</p>

<p>I accordingly served out my four years at Wetumpka, Ala.,
and all to avoid going to Mississippi to be tried for the murder
of Harvey.</p>

<p>However, I did not evade the rigor of the laws of Mississippi.
The vigilance of the Sheriff of Perry county threw a guard
around me, that secured to him the possession of my person at
the expiration of my time in the penitentiary of Alabama, and he
immediately transferred me to the county jail of Perry county,
Mississippi.</p>

<p>I remained in the jail of Perry and Covington counties upward
of two years before I had a trial. I was found guilty of
murder; and the sentence of death was passed upon me, and
the day appointed for my execution. Within eight days of
the time the Sheriff informed me that my time was only eight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
days, and that my rope, shroud and burial clothes were all ready.
He then read to me the death warrant! My tongue nor pen
cannot express my feelings on that occasion during that day
and night. However, to my great joy, the next morning he
brought me the glorious news that the clerk of the court had
received a supersedeas and order to respite my execution, and
carry my case to the High Court of Errors and Appeals.</p>

<p>I cannot express my joyful feelings on receiving this intelligence.
It removed that cloud of horror and despair, which was
lowering upon and around me, and renovated anew my whole
soul. It was to me as a refulgent light from the sun of heaven
cast upon the dark and gloomy vale; but, alas, how ephemeral
that sunshine of joy and bliss! That fickle dame, Fortune,
upon whose wheel I had so successfully floated in former days,
finally brought me to the same point where I started.</p>

<p>I was, therefore, conveyed from the Perry county jail to the
State penitentiary at Jackson, to await there a hearing of my
case in the High Court of Errors and Appeals, and remained
there about two years. In the meanwhile my case was argued
before this Court, and the judgment reversed, and the cause
remanded for further proceedings in the Circuit Court of Perry
county.</p>

<p>This day comes George Wood, the District Attorney, who
prosecutes for the State of Mississippi, and the prisoner is
brought to the bar, in custody of the Sheriff, whereupon comes
a jury of good and lawful men, to wit: Porter J. Myers,
Malachi Odom, Sr., J. M. Bradley, Jr., Darling Lott, Malcolm
McCallum, Angus McSwain, Q. A. Bradley, J. M. Bradley, Sr.,
Wm. H. Nicols, W. C. Griffin, D. S. Sapp and James Edwards,
who are regularly summoned, elected and sworn, and well and
truly to try an issue joined, ore tenus, whether or not the prisoner
be of sound mind, and whether he possesses sufficient intellect
to comprehend the cause of the proceedings on the
trial, so as to be able to make a proper defense; or whether the
appearance of insanity, if any such be proven, is feigned or
not; and the evidence having been submitted to them in the
presence of the prisoner, they retired to consider of their verdict,
and in his presence returned the following, to-wit: “We,
the jury, on our oaths, find the prisoner sane; that he possesses
sufficient intellect to comprehend the cause of the prosecution
on the trial, so as to be able to make a proper defense, and
that the appearance of insanity which he has exhibited, is
feigned.”</p>

<p>And thereupon the prisoner is arraigned on the charge of
murder, as preferred by the bill of indictment; and upon said
arraignment, says that he is not guilty in manner and form as
therein and thereby charged, and for the truth of said plea he
puts himself upon the country; and the District Attorney in
behalf of the State of Mississippi doeth the like.</p>

<p>And thereon come the following good and lawful men of
Perry county, to-wit: Zebulon Hollingsworth, J. J. Bradley,
John A. Carnes, Francis A. Allen, Wm. W. Dunn, Adam Laird,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
who were regularly summoned on the special venue returned
in this case, and who in the presence of the prisoner are regularly
tried and chosen between the prisoner and the State; and
the special venue being exhausted the Sheriff proceeded to call
the regular jurors in attendance at this term, and Daniel S.
Sapp, Seaborne Hollingsworth and Francis Martin were in the
presence of the prisoner tried, and chosen between the State
and the prisoner; and the regular jury being exhausted, the
Sheriff is directed to summon thirteen bystanders as jurors,
and from the number so summoned as last aforesaid, Milton J.
Albritton was in presence of the prisoner duly tried and chosen
between the State and the prisoner; and the said thirteen persons
so last summoned being exhausted, it is ordered that a
venue issue, commanding the Sheriff to summon twenty good
and lawful men of Perry county, to be and appear before the
court to-morrow morning at 8 o’clock, A. M., to serve as jurors
in the trial of the issue aforesaid, and the prisoner is remanded
to jail, and John W. Carter is sworn as bailiff to take charge of
the jury.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_EXECUTION">THE EXECUTION.</h2>
</div>


<p>The day arose clear and beautiful on which the sentence of
the law and of outraged humanity was to be executed on the
man who had so often violated their most sacred behests. The
sky was blue and serene; the atmosphere genial; all nature
was calm and peaceful; man alone was agitated by the various
strong emotions which the execution of the fatal sentence of
retributive justice on a fellow-man could not but create.</p>

<p>The place of execution was distant from the city of Augusta
one-quarter of a mile. The gallows was erected on a beautiful
elevation that was surrounded by the verdure of shrubby oak
and the tall, long-leaf pine. The ground was everywhere
occupied by thousands of spectators, gathered from Perry and
the surrounding counties, to witness the solemn scene. It was
indeed one that they will long remember.</p>

<p>About the hour of noon, the prisoner, after being neatly
clad, was led from the jail by the officers of the law, placed in
the ranks of the guard formed for the occasion, and the procession
moved slowly toward the fatal spot.</p>

<p>Soon the doomed man appeared on the gallows. The death
warrant was then read to him, and he was informed that he
had but a short time to live.</p>

<p>He proceeded to address the awe-struck and silent multitude.
He especially urged the young men present to take warning
from his career and fate, and to avoid bad company. His misfortune
he attributed principally to having been misled while
young.</p>

<p>When he had concluded, a number of questions were asked
by the immediate spectators, in relation to crimes which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
transpired within their knowledge; but he would give no direct
answer—shrewdly eluding the inquiries.</p>

</figure>

<p>The Sheriff then asked him, in hearing of many lookers-on,
if the details of his confession, previously made to that officer,
were true. He replied that they were.</p>

<p>His hands were then tied and the cap pulled over his face,
and he was told that he had but a few moments to live. He
exclaimed, “Lord, have mercy on me!” and he was praying
when the drop fell, and a brief struggle ended his blood-stained
career.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Written the night before his Execution.</i>)</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Augusta, Mississippi</span>, October 29th, 1857.<br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Rebecca Copeland</span>:<br>
</p>

<p><em>My dear Mother</em>—It is with painful feelings indeed, that I
attempt writing to you on the present occasion. I take this
opportunity, knowing at the same time, that it is the last one
of the kind which I shall ever be permitted to enjoy while here
on earth. It is long and much that I have suffered while in
prison since my first confinement in Mobile county, and yet it
seems as though nothing will pay the debt but my life. I have
had my trial and was convicted upon a charge of murder, and
I have received the awful sentence of death. The sheriff told
me to-day, that to-morrow at 2 o’clock I will be hanged, according
to the order of court. Oh, my dear mother, what an
awful sound is this to reach your ear. Oh, would it could be
otherwise; but you are aware that I justly merit the sentence.
You are knowing to my being a bad man; and dear mother, had
you given me the proper advice when young, I would now perhaps
be doing well. It is often I have meditated on this subject
since my confinement in prison, and often have I recollected
my good old father’s advice when I was young, and repented a
thousand times over, with sorrow and regret, that I have failed
to receive it as good, benevolent advice. If such a course I had
taken, I have no doubt, but what I would be doing well at this
time. But it is too late now to talk of things past and gone.
The time has come when I shall have to take my departure
from this world, and it pains my heart, to know that I have to
leave you and my brothers and sisters; and much am I mortified
to think how distantly you have treated me while here in
prison. Not the first time have you been to see me; but I can
freely excuse you for all this, and I do hope you will prepare to
meet Jesus in Heaven.</p>

<p>Dear Mother, long has the time been that life was not any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
satisfaction to me. I am now in the dungeon with the cold
and icy bands clasped around me, and cold as clay. Much
have I suffered, but after two o’clock to-morrow, my troubles
will all be over, or worse than they are at present. This I am
not able to tell. I have been preparing to meet my God, praying
diligently for mercy and for the pardon of my sins, but I
do not know whether my prayers have been heard or not.—The
Scriptures say “that the spirit of the Lord shall not always
strive with man,” and again say: “he that calls upon the Lord
in the last hours shall be saved.” If so, I feel some spark of
hope, but I tell you this hope is hanging upon a slender thread.</p>

<p>Dear Mother, it makes the tears trickle down my cold checks
to have to pen this statement to you. Dear Mother, I have to
close this letter. My heart is overflowed already, so when you
receive this, you can keep it as a memorial, and remember that
poor Jim is no more on earth; that he has bid you a long
farewell.</p>

<p>Dear Mother, it appears as though my heart will break at the
very thought of this. Oh, could I but see you once more before
my death, it would give my aching heart some relief; but
we have to part without this pleasure.</p>

<p>Now my good old Mother, I bid you a long farewell, forever
and forever.</p>

THE LAST BOLD EFFORTS TO SAVE THE LIFE OF JAMES COPELAND<br>
PROVED INEFFECTUAL; BUT THE SAME AGENTS SUCCEEDED<br>
BY REFINED MOVEMENTS IN PROCURING THE<br>
ACQUITTAL OF JOHN COPELAND.<br>
</p>
</div>


<p>The organization of the Wages and Copeland Clan embraced
a diversified talent of an extraordinary grade in different departments
of operations. It commanded some of the ablest
ability belonging to the bar and the medical profession, with
other agents who could be hired or engaged for temporary
assistance. It requires more than a cursory contemplation to
anything like a full comprehension of the lengths, and breadths,
and depths of its vast theaters of operations. Many, perhaps,
not admitted to the council and secret conclaves of the
organization, could be engaged for a stipulated sum to perform
important services in defense and protection of its active members,
who might inwardly condemn its pernicious fields of operations
against the best interests of society. Whether such
conduct can stand the test of reason and argument it is for
others, with the reader, to determine. The worse the case the
richer the fees for the lawyer, and so of the medical profession.
As frequently happens, the lawyer scruples at nothing to win
a victory for his client. In some places this course is fashionable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
and not at all odious. As long as the attorney keeps
his defense within legitimate bounds, and avails himself of
every lawful opportunity for the advantage of his client, no well-balanced
mind can be disposed to censure, because on the other
side, the prosecution will do the same. But when foul and
corrupt means are resorted to; when the most vicious and depraved
of actions are brought in play to screen the guilty and
make crime respectable, then it is that public sentiment should
be loud against such abominations, no matter whether against
the medical or legal profession, or against any other class who
can be brought to perform the services of infamy.</p>

<p>The period betwixt the imprisonment and execution of James
Copeland, three parties from Alabama came and settled in Perry
county, Miss., one in, and the other two about Augusta. These
three performed their part so well—so concealed and reserved
as to pass for gentlemen in the highest degree respectable. But
few, if any, had suspicion until afterward of their object to
assist the captured in escaping the last penalties of outraged
law.</p>

<p>One of the three, who settled in Augusta; a skilled doctor and
surgeon, behaved himself so well in every respect—on all occasions
exhibiting a winning and an affable deportment—everybody’s
friend with the most lavish of generosity—sparing no
exertions to gain the confidence and admiration of those in
power and of influence; this is the man who proposed to the
sheriff the plan to save the life of James Copeland. This
proposition was made betwixt the time of his conviction and
execution. The particulars are as follows:—The doctor to the
sheriff: “There is now a fine opportunity of making one thousand
dollars in gold, providing that you will act in concert with me
in permitting certain things to be done before the execution of
Copeland.” There was something so bland, so expert, and so
graceful in the conduct of the strange doctor as to make him
friends wherever he went. He insinuated himself into the
confidence of the sheriff; and when the proposition was made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
for certain things to be done before execution, for and in consideration
of a thousand dollars, the curiosity of the sheriff
could not be otherwise than powerfully excited to learn all
particulars of the plan in contemplation, and, accordingly, so
far indulged or humored the beginning so as to obtain the
whole of what was then behind. The doctor continued, and
gave the name of him who had a thousand dollars to pay for
the preservation of the life of Copeland; and to be done in the
following manner, secure from exciting any suspicion whatever.
The doctor to the sheriff: “Allow me about half an hour before
the time arrives for your taking him out of jail to the place of
execution, to go in under the pretence of shaving and dressing
him suitably to the solemnity of the occasion, during which
time I will perform an operation in tracheotomy by inserting
into the trachea, or wind-pipe, a small silver tube sufficient for
the admission of air into the lungs to keep up some degree of
respiration, so that when he shall have hung the allotted time,
he can be cut down and by an extension of the tube, he can
be so buried as to prevent the extinction of life; which, as soon
as convenient, he can be disinterred and so cared for by artful
means until the recovery so far progress as will enable him to
successfully escape.”</p>

<p>The sheriff listened to all this with a smile, and treated the
whole as rather a plausible romance than a possible reality;
but firm to the duties of his office, he yielded not to the temptation;
yet to maintain good faith as to what transpired before
the proposition was fully made, and for prudent considerations
in regard to his own safety, he has refrained from publishing
this narrative at an earlier date, because conscious that the
public interests, though delayed, would best be served by so
doing in the long run.</p>

<p>Shortly after the execution of James, John Copeland, the
brother of the former, was arrested, brought to the same jail,
and tried in the same case, and for the same crime of murder.</p>

<p>The State was represented by George Wood, Esq., and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
defence by Wirt Adams as principal. Both sides labored hard
and wonderfully skillful. The argument of the latter occupied
about three or four hours in delivery. The evidence
against John Copeland was quite as strong as against his convicted
brother, but the juries were of different material. The
three strange immigrants from Alabama, who then had recently
settled in and about Augusta, managed to get on the jury.
This was not hard to do, as the county had pretty much been
exhausted before to get an acceptable jury not disqualified by
some objections brought forth. When the jury retired, the
three here referred to, having the most ingenuity, lead the other
remaining part, the consequence of which was a verdict of
acquittal. This verdict aroused the indignation of the public
both far and near—murmurs everywhere, and satisfaction nowhere.
So irritated were the populace that, in all probability,
the life of Copeland would have been taken by violence the
night after his liberation, but for the timely notice given him
for immediate escape.</p>

<p>The following morning he was heard from as being seen on
the opposite side of Leaf river, about thirty miles below
Augusta, in the direction for Pascagoula river. It is supposed
he went almost direct to Angelina county, Texas, where his
mother and family settled after leaving Mississippi.</p>

<p>But little time had elapsed after this before the Sheriff of
Perry received a letter from Col. Pickering, of this (Angelina)
county, warning him of the necessity of being on his guard—that
Thomas, another brother of the Copeland family, had left
that vicinity for Mississippi; and, according to the general belief
there, with a design on the life of the Sheriff; but although
he passed through the county of Perry, by the way of Black
Creek, to Mobile, Alabama, yet if he made any secret movement
for the assassination, he never knew it.</p>

<p>The Copeland family, in Angelina county, instituted a formidable
prosecution against Col. Pickering, but his reception
of the pamphlet containing the confession, caused the District<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
Attorney of that place to dismiss the prosecution, and for this
the Copeland family was heard to swear vengeance against the
Sheriff who had published them; therefore, well taken were
the grounds of fear entertained by Col. Pickering. Immediately
after the acquittal of John Copeland, the three strange
immigrants left for parts unknown.</p>


<h3 id="ARCH-MONSTER_OF_ATROCITY">S. S. SHOEMAKE, THE ARCH-MONSTER OF ATROCITY AND THE PERFECTION
OF DECEPTION, WITH HIS JOHN R. GARLAND LETTER.</h3>

<p>An organization may soon come to naught, even though
founded on principles in every respect sound, healthy and legitimate,
if the individuals composing it are defective in brains
and energy, the exercise of which are essentially necessary for
continued existence. But an organization, based on the contrary
of such principles, may continue for years to perpetrate
the darkest of human atrocities—spreading terror or devastation
both far and wide, if its members, or the leaders, possess
the mental force requisite to plan, to command and to execute
according to the proper definitions of skill, disguised treachery,
and firm intrepidity brought to bear against the less suspecting,
but the more honest members of society.</p>

<p>The unfolding of the character of S. S. Shoemake will reveal
all the traits of vice, of meanness, of guilt, and of all which
contributes to the perfection of human treason and perfidy.</p>

<p>Some of the most masterly strokes of guile and consummate
deception are to be found in his John R. Garland letter and
the subsequent circumstances with it connected. The ancient
Judas fell very far short in comparison with this modern specimen
of cruelty, of plunder, and of hypocritical imposture.
A marauder, a being destitute of honor, pride or principle,
and the very incarnation of all that is vile and abhorrent. This
is the man whose character, to some extent, will next be unveiled
in detail.</p>

<p>But a short time elapsed after the publication of Copeland’s
confessions until a letter, signed John R. Garland, was received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
by the Sheriff of Perry county, making inquiry about
S. S. Shoemake and two others by the names of J. and D.
Doty—all implicated in Copeland’s confessions. This letter,
as will afterward be shown, was written by Shoemake himself,
and was mailed at DeKalb, Kemper county, Mississippi, the
substance of which will next be given:</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">DeKalb, Miss.</span>, October —, 1858.<br>
</p>

<p>
<em>J. R. S. Pitts, Sheriff Perry County, Miss.</em>:<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>—As I feel very much interested in the future welfare
of this immediate section of our country, and am desirous
of ascertaining the names of all men of degraded character,
so far as practicable, who might chance to live among us, and
more especially those characters as represented to you by
Copeland, in his recent confessions as a united band of land
pirates, which fact has been apparent with me for some years
past of the existence of such a clan throughout our entire
country. And believing that we have some of the same characters
residing within our midst, I thus communicate in confidence
to you, trusting that you will be kind enough, on the
reception of this, to answer the same, and inform me whether
or not the names of S. S. Shoemake, and two other men here,
J. Doty and D. Doty, are the same persons as implicated by
Copeland in his confessions to you.</p>

<p>So far as the former character is concerned, there is no doubt
existing in the minds of the people here but that he belongs to
some secret clan. His conduct, and every action through life,
go to establish this conclusion. He spends the greater portion
of his time away from home, and at times is absent
from home for months, none knowing here anything
of his whereabouts. And in this way, to the mystery
of every one, he makes his peregrinations throughout the
country, but whether near or distant is unknown to us. Frequently
after having been absent until the community would
begin to wonder and ask the question as to the cause of such
continued detention, as well as the actuating motives for so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
much of absence, but none can give any solution—none any
intelligence in reference to him. To say the least, there is
great suspicion mingled with much curiosity.</p>

<p>Generally when he returns home from making those protracted
journeys, he manages so as to arrive some time during the
night, bringing with him droves of horses, mules, and sometimes
more or less negroes. After his return, the first thing that is
known of him, he is seen in the grog-shop bright and early in
the morning, waiting the arrival of the bar-keeper for his morning
bitters. In this way he seems to be continually whiling
away his time—claiming to be acting in behalf of a State committee.
On meeting this person, S. S. Shoemake, one that is
not personally acquainted with him would not for a moment
suspect anything wrong, for he is calculated by his affable deportment,
on first acquaintance to make a very favorable impression
on the mind.</p>

<p>As we feel much interested in this vicinity relative to this
matter, I trust that you will, on receipt of this, give us the desired
information above asked for, as there is no favor within
your power that you could at this time extend to us that would
be received with so much gratitude.</p>

<p>When addressing your communication, you will please remember
not to direct to me, but simply address your letter to
box, No. 27, DeKalb, Kemper County, Mississippi.</p>

<p>I make the above request in order that my designs may not
be frustrated—also, you will please suffer no person to see this
communication.</p>

<p>Hoping to hear from you soon, I remain,</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 3.5em;">Very respectfully,</span><br>
<br>
<span class="smcap">John R. Garland</span>.<br>
</p>

<p>This extraordinary letter elicited the following reply:</p>

<p id="SHERIFFS_REPLY" class="right">
<span class="smcap">Augusta, Mississippi</span>, ——, 1858.<br>
</p>

<p>
<em>John R. Garland, DeKalb, Miss.</em>:<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>—I am in receipt of yours bearing a recent date,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
asking me for information relative to certain characters within
your vicinity. Giving three names, you wish to know if they
are the same persons who were implicated by Copeland in his
confession to me.</p>

<p>In answer, at the time of writing the confession, I could have
located all the parties given me as members belonging to the
Wages and Copeland clan, but did not at the time deem it expedient
to do so, because believing that the people in the different
sections of the country wherever they might live would be
very apt to know them from their general character. But
from the description you give of S. S. Shoemake, and from
one memorable remark that Copeland made at the time he gave
me this name, I am constrained to favor the opinion that he is
the same person as both he and yourself have pointed out.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">Very respectfully,</span><br>
<br>
<span class="smcap">J. R. S. Pitts</span>.<br>

<h3 id="SHOEMAKE_VISITS_THE_SHERRIF">SHOEMAKE VISITS THE SHERIFF IN PERSON WITH HIS BOGUS AUTHORITY
FROM THE PROBATE JUDGE OF KEMPER COUNTY.</h3>

<p>But a short time intervened after the correspondence until
Shoemake himself suddenly made his appearance in person at
the door of the parlor in which the sheriff at the time was engaged
in reading. In reaching so far, Shoemake had
passed the outer gate, fronting the street, unnoticed
by the watch-dog, or by any of Hon. Drewry Bynum’s family
with whom the sheriff was boarding. Shoemake boldly opened
the parlor door, and, after a graceful and dignified salutation,
next inquired if the sheriff was present. Being answered in
the affirmative, he was then invited to walk in and take a seat,
for which he returned the usual compliments of civility. His
next expressed wish was to retire to the sheriff’s office, which
was situated within a few paces of the dwelling-house—all enclosed
within the same yard, as he had communications to make
on official business. Both retired accordingly, when, as soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
as properly seated, Shoemake drew from his breast-pocket a
large document, written in a beautiful style and evidently prepared
with great care and taste. This instrument of writing
was produced to show his authority from the Probate Judge
of Kemper county to pursue and apprehend a certain person
named and described, for stealing eleven negroes belonging to
minor heirs of said county. This instrument of authority was
soon detected as counterfeit—not having the legal impress—the
court seal of the county from which it pretended to have emanated.
This fact, in connection with the introduction of his
own name, very properly put the Sheriff on his guard as to
subsequent movements which were to follow. Shoemake continued
to the effect that the thief, from the direction in which
he had been traveling, would be more than likely to cross at
the junction of Bowie creek with Leaf river, which is situated
about twenty miles above Augusta. Shoemake further added
his belief that the thief was making for some point on the seashore
at or near Mississippi City, and that he had called on the
Sheriff to accompany and assist him in the capture. To this
application the Sheriff peremptorily refused, remarking at the
same time that the Probate Court was then in session, and that
he could not be absent for the period of time necessarily required
in a task of this sort without material injury to business
transactions and the duties of his office. To this unqualified
refusal Shoemake sat for a moment in a silent pause. If the
Sheriff himself could not accompany him, he had no desire to
have any of the deputies with him.</p>

<p>Appearing very much disappointed in this object to decoy off
the Sheriff, and feeling satisfied that all further attempts in this
direction would prove abortive, he all at once exhibited a different
phase of countenance, and in a jocular manner slapped the
Sheriff on the knee, remarking at the same time, “How or
where did you get my name associated with the Copeland
Clan?” The Sheriff answered, “Why, my dear sir, do you
acknowledge the name as recorded in Copeland’s confessions as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
belonging to you?” Shoemake made no direct reply, but observed
that the people about where he lived were endeavoring
to saddle the reflections on him, and that the same was having
a very deleterious effect against him. This being so, he requested
of the Sheriff, as an act of favor or kindness, to have
his name erased, or disposed of in some other way, such as
would remove the odium attached, and that he believed the
Sheriff to have the power to do all this with propriety. The
Sheriff was a little startled as well as excited at such an absurd
proposition, and quickly replied to the following effect: “Your
requested favor cannot be performed. The matter has altogether
passed out of my hands, and it is utterly beyond my
control to make any changes. I have only given publicity to
the confessions of Copeland, and if he has wrongfully implicated
any one the remedy is by an action of law, or better still, by a
counter statement supported by the testimony of those whose
veracity cannot be doubted.”</p>

<p>Shoemake, discomfitted in his own case on this point, then
referred to a correspondence betwixt himself, George A. Cleaveland
and others, all of whom were implicated in the pamphlet
complained of, and said, from all the information he could
gather, unless something was done to relieve the complainants
the Sheriff would be sure to have more or less trouble from
that quarter. The reply made was pretty much to the same
effect as in his own individual case—no hope of success as far
as the Sheriff was concerned.</p>

<p>The next question brought forward was an inquiry about a
communication from some one at DeKalb, Miss., concerning
himself. He was answered in the affirmative to the effect that
such a communication had been received. “Very well,” said
he, “will you be so kind as to let me see it?”</p>

<p>“I cannot,” replied the Sheriff, “and for this reason, that
the author of it made a special request not to let any person
see it; consequently I cannot without a breach of good faith, do
violence to the request made and involve myself in difficulties,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
when all can be so easily avoided.” This reply did not satisfy
him. He again solicitously pressed for inspection, urging that
some d—d rascal had been writing about him, and that he believed
it was one by the name of White. He was informed
immediately that no person by that name had ever sent any
communication whatever, and that he was certainly laboring
under wrong impressions in this particular.</p>

<p>He utterly failed to get to see the communication in every
effort made for this purpose. The effects were visibly marked
on his countenance. Rage and anger, despair and disappointment,
with all other of defeated passions, seemed to flit over
him in rapid succession; but without any representation in
words—only rising with a farewell, such as appeared to the
Sheriff ominous of something else, and anything but pleasant
in his judgment. After leaving the office he remained in Augusta
but a very short time, and when about leaving the place
altogether he was heard to say that he would some day meet
the Sheriff “at the hatter’s shop.”</p>


<h3 id="SHOMEMAKE_RETURNS_WITH_A_WRIT">SHOEMAKE RETURNS WITH A WRIT FOR THE SHERIFF’S ARREST.</h3>

<p>For some five or six weeks after his departure the Sheriff
heard nothing more of him; at the expiration of which time he
returned in company with a man by the name of Gilbert, though
in reality supposed to be one of the Copeland family. This
time he bore a requisition from the Governor of Alabama to
the Governor of Mississippi for the body of the Sheriff; and
strange, and to this day mysterious as it may appear, the requisition
was granted.</p>

<p>Some few days previous to the arrival of Shoemake and his
assistant, the Sheriff had left Augusta for the Mississippi Sound
on a journey to make arrangements for hymenial considerations.
Learning the facts of his absence, they set about gathering
all the information they could from negroes and the less
suspecting class of others relative to his whereabouts and the
anticipated time for his return. Having got the information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
wanted, forthwith they started in pursuit—traveling the same
way by which he was compelled to return to Augusta. It is
called the Mississippi Cut Road—better known by the name of
the Allsberry and McRae railroad. It runs on range line eight,
from Augusta to Mississippi City—all the timber on this line
being cut and cleared away some thirty-five years ago. It
failed of completion, it is said, through the dishonesty of one
or more on whom the responsibility devolved; and the only
relic now remaining is a good dirt road, for the benefit of the
present traveling community.</p>

<p>On this road, not a great distance from Red Creek, there is
an extensive morass, which has been cross-wayed for public
accommodation, which otherwise would be impassable on horseback.
When Shoemake and his assistant arrived at this place
they remained, according to the statements of persons in the
neighborhood, one or two days in ambush, stationing themselves
one on each side of the cross-way, evidently with a design
to prevent the Sheriff from seeing either until he had advanced
some distance on it, then to close in upon him from both
directions, which would have prevented any earthly chance of
escape by any other way—the morass is of such a nature as to
swallow up in any other part.</p>

<figure class="figcenter width800 illowp80" id="facing135">
  <img class="w100" src="images/facing135.jpg" alt="A man on a horse rides away from the Copelan Clan behind him.">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Author making his escape from two of the Copeland
Clan.</span>—[See <a href="#Page_135">Page 135</a>.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At last becoming impatient, they decided to move on toward
the Gulf; and, accordingly, stopped at Red Creek for the night
following. But, let it be borne in mind, that they so arranged
as to remain at different houses, one on the north, and the
other on the south side of the creek, so as to be certain not to
miss the Sheriff on his return by that way. The houses where
they stopped at for the night were near the ferry—kept for the
accommodation of travelers. If the Sheriff had left the coast
that morning, as anticipated by the two, he, according to the
day’s ride, would have been almost certain to have reached one
of the houses here referred to, as no other suitable place near
could have been found, which would have brought him in direct
contact with the pursuers. But by being detained that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
morning at Mississippi City, he did not leave in time to reach
either place where they were staying, and he of necessity
stopped the night in question with an old gentleman by the
name of Byrd—about fifteen or twenty miles from the ferry.
This old gentleman had been a resident of that section of
country for a great number of years, and was well acquainted
with Wages and McGrath; also with the truth of many of the
incidents as related in Copeland’s confessions.</p>

<p>After the usual breakfast hour next morning, the Sheriff
availed himself of the earliest opportunity to resume his travel
toward Augusta. On his way, some ten or fifteen miles distant
from where he that morning started, to his great surprise, he
suddenly came in contact with Shoemake and his colleague.
They were seated within a one-horse buggy, with another very
fine animal fastened to it, and with saddle and other necessaries
ready for the rider in case any emergency might occur.
They all met together on the top of a little hill, quite steep,
with such other circumstances attending as obstructed sight
until in quite close contact. The place of meeting was not
more than fifty paces from an occupied dwelling house. This
fact was, no doubt, the main cause of preventing them from
making, perhaps, a fatal attack. The meeting was as of perfect
strangers, though, in reality, each side knew the other
again. The Sheriff well knew Shoemake, and, from his uneasy
countenance, as well as the countenance of the other with
him, the Sheriff was satisfied that they knew him.</p>

<p>He having passed, as he thought, a sufficient distance beyond
their view, he increased the speed of his horse to a rate of
about eight or nine miles an hour for the remainder of the day,
which carried him some fifty miles or more from the spot of
meeting. He was fully impressed with the idea, at the time of
meeting, that they were in pursuit of him for evil and dangerous
purposes, which idea was fully confirmed by information
gathered that day on travel as to their very suspicious conduct
at different points of progress; however, in his heart, he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
thankful that he had so far made his escape. His rapid travel
onwards for that day was lonely indeed—passing through a
wild, desolate region of country, but very sparsely populated—for
miles not a human being to be seen; stock in abundance on
either side of the road, with here and there frightened deer at
seeing him, as it were, flying through space for safety and repose.
Night fast coming on, with exhausted fatigue from
excessive exercise, and beginning to despair of reaching home
that night, he resolved on going to the house of a well-known
friend, J. T. Breeland, situated a distance from the highway,
and had to be approached with the convenience of a by-path.
He succeeded in reaching this house in time for late supper.
Here he met with all the accommodations that heart could
desire. Luxuries plenty, conversation agreeable, with a welcomeness
which must ever be appreciated, and more than this,
consolation afforded when most needed. The next was retirement
for sleep, but little of sound repose was enjoyed; the
ghastly scenes of the clan were before his eyes, with struggles
for existence betwixt him and his pursuers.</p>

<p>Early next morning, an ample breakfast having been supplied,
he, after having received many kindly admonitions from
his friend by way of strict caution, left, and reached home,
Augusta, about ten o’clock next morning; and about twelve
o’clock, only two hours later, Shoemake, with his colleague,
also reached the same place.</p>

<p>Immediately on their arrival, he made every preparation for
battle, determined to repel force by force if that was their object.
But collision was prevented by a timely notice from Hon.
Wm. Simmons, to the effect that they had authority from the
Governor of Mississippi for his arrest, and that he was at
liberty to see the same.</p>

<p>In obedient response to this exhibited authority, Shoemake
and his colleague were informed that if they would wait a
sufficient length of time to make ready with a number of
friends for protection to accompany, he would have no objection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
whatever to going with them. Their polite answer came
to the following effect: “That if desired, they would wait any
reasonable length of time to enable him to have all the conveniences
wanted.”</p>

<p>The news and circumstances connected with his arrest spread
throughout the country with almost the speed of electricity.
In many instances the reports were very much exaggerated—causing
many persons, on the spur of the moment, to become
furiously incensed, to such an extent as to threaten the most
formidable results of desperation; and but for his appeals for
order and due process of law, the most fatal acts of violence
might have been committed.</p>

<p>Within a period of three or four days, he had so arranged
his business as to be in entire readiness for departure, and so
gave notice accordingly. Punctual to the time, he, with about
twenty volunteers, mounted and well equipped for protection,
when arrangements were made for immediate departure for
Mobile, Alabama, all leaving merrily, and soon reached the
place of destination. Arriving at the Lafayette House, kept
by a Mr. Fulton, in the city of Mobile, all fared while there
very sumptuously.</p>

<p>As early as practicable the next morning, the Sheriff went to
the office of Hon. Percy Walker, to procure his professional
services. This object being accomplished by a compensating
fee of five hundred dollars. The next thing to be done was
for his counsel to ascertain the amount of the several bonds to
be given as required by law. This task was quickly over, the
bonds satisfactorily given, and he was immediately released.
These last incidents transpired about or near the middle of
January, 1859; and the City Court was to open on the 23d of
February, following, allowing thirty or forty days to prepare
for defence. But before continuing in the connected order,
some comments are necessary on what has preceded already.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>


<h3>SHOEMAKE’S OBJECT WAS ASSASSINATION.</h3>

<p>A character so infamously conspicuous as Shoemake’s is,
should not ordinarily be passed over. It should be thoroughly
understood so far as his diabolical conduct is known; and this,
in all probability, is only a small part of his treacherous and
bloody career. Well might James Copeland remark to the
Sheriff in prison: “This said Shoemake is a big dog among
us.” The foregoing reports of Shoemake’s operations are not
all; he will again be introduced as playing a distinguished
part on the subsequent trial of the Sheriff, and when he will
there be pointed out as the main witness for the prosecution,
with his oath invalidated, and the worst features of perjury
attaching; these, in conjunction with the facts established on
trial, sufficiently proved him to be the author of the “John R.
Garland letter.”</p>

<p>The human machine, as a whole, because of common appearance,
does not strike the attention with that force which is
essential to a full comprehension of the grand and mighty work
produced by an invisible and inscrutable agency of an unseen
power. It is dissection, analyzation, and physiological researches
which only can reveal the wonderful structure and
astounding recovery of the human system. Shoemake’s vast
fields of diversified operations—mixed, complicated, and clothed
in every external form of delusion, when viewed as a whole,
but a very imperfect idea can be reached of this covert and
monster man. Dissection and analyzation are necessary. The
main-springs of his movements must be brought to light. The
veils and curtains must be torn away so that the internal workings
of his soul can be seen.</p>

<p>Let the reader go back to the time of his writing the John
R. Garland letter. There will be found a master-piece of dissimulation.
Under a fictitious signature, he describes himself,
in some particulars of crime and lawlessness, with astonishing
accuracy. He gives instructions for the reply to be sent without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
name to a numbered box in the post office, at DeKalb, under the
pretensions of favoring the spread of the printed “confessions”
and of dealing heavy blows against Shoemake—the most desperate
of human characters.</p>

<p>Some two or three weeks after, this followed by his visit in
person to the sheriff of Perry county. Here, suddenly and
unexpectedly, he reaches the door of the apartment where
the sheriff was seated, unnoticed by the watch dog or by any
member of the family. Opens the door and puts on the airs
of gentlemanly civility. Pretends to have important official
business, so much so as to require secrecy in the sheriff’s
office. There exhibiting high authority, but feigned and spurious,
for capturing a renowned thief, who had succeeded in getting
away with eleven negroes; and wants the sheriff to accompany
him on such an important expedition over roads wile and
desolate. Failing in this object, he next introduces the subject
of his own, the John R. Garland letter, and said it had been
written by a d——d rascal by the name of White—urging with
all his powers of solicitation to see the letter, but without success.
He furthermore attempts, by all the arts of sophistry,
to induce the sheriff to make changes in the “confessions,”
and, failing in this, then tries the weapons of intimidation by
declaring that trouble more or less must fall on the sheriff if
something were not done to relieve George A. Cleaveland and
others in Mobile.</p>

<p>The reader perfectly understanding the above, must certainly
come to the following conclusion, that Shoemake had a threefold
object in view by this visit to the sheriff. First, and the
most preferable, was assassination, and, if no opportunity offered
for this in his office, to get him off, under false pretensions,
on solitary and dreary roads for the better accomplishment
of the same. Secondly, to get hold of the John R. Garland
letter, which he knew must be very dangerous in any
other hands but his own. Thirdly, to publicly kill the sheriff
and the “confessions” by inducing him to make changes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>Shoemake when next he appeared in Augusta, it was on a different
mission. This time, he was armed with real authority
from the Governor of Mississippi for the arrest of the sheriff.
But finding him absent, he assiduously and very ingeniously
sets to work to gather all possible information as to his whereabouts
and the time for his return. This done, in hot pursuit
he makes his departure for the seizure of his object. He
travels forward with alacrity until he reaches an extensive
morass; then, with his colleague, ambushes both sides of it,
for a day or two, so as to close in from both ways, if opportunity
afforded, on his object, and make escape impossible—ready
with a convenient horse for any emergency which might occur.
Despairing of meeting with the sought after prize, onward he
goes until he reaches the ferry—the distance of a day’s ride
from Mississippi City, where he expected another opportunity
for getting hold of the man he wanted—so arranges as for
one to remain on each side of the ferried river—again rendering
passage impossible without discovery. Again disappointed,
onwards he proceeds, and in a short time comes in contact
with the person in pursuit of, but in such a situation as to mar
his purposes at that point. They pass, both sides knowing
each other. He travels a short distance forward—then turns
back after his object, who has fled at the rate of about eight or
nine miles the hour—succeeds in reaching Augusta only two
hours behind his object. Then makes known his mission of
arrest—seeing the tremendous public excitement prevailing
which threatened his existence, politely agrees to wait a reasonable
length of time for his nominal prisoner—four days waiting
for in making preparatory arrangements to have a sufficient
protective force to accompany, when all set out for Mobile—here
reached, then, the sheriff in the buggy with him, then
drives rapidly down one street, up another, and round the corners
with a velocity that kept some three or four of the protective
force in a gallop to keep up with the speed.</p>

<p>The reader will once more draw his own inferences. He will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
plainly see that the principal aim again was assassination as
the better method among outlaws of disposing of troublesome
persons. The lying in ambush for one or two whole days on
both sides of the morass, on both sides of the next river, the
hurried rapidity of the return to overtake the sheriff before
reaching Augusta, and the last effort to get clear of the “protective
force” in the city of Mobile by forced speed through complicated
streets; all these facts in connection are plain to the
unprejudiced mind as to the ultimate object in view. Indirectly
corroborative, there is another fact, which will be further noticed
in the sequel, to the effect of one by the name of Cornelious
McLamore from Kemper county, an important witness on
trial, who crushingly and effectively broke down the testimony
of the said Shoemake, but in all probability his life paid the
forfeit; for McLamore from that time to the present has never
more been heard of—his remains likely burnt or buried in some
dismal swamp—another victim to the vengeance of the “clan.”</p>

<p>Shoemake, the big dog among the band, this is the man,
this the agent from the Governor of Alabama, from the Governor
of Mississippi, employed to execute the highest of delegated
State authority! If the then Governor of Mississippi
can reconcile the rectitude of such action to his mind, the public
is very far from approving the same. At the time the press
from almost every quarter was loud in its denunciations against
the conduct of the Governor. He must have known that the
extensive ramifications of the Wages and Copeland Clan had
produced a reign of terror almost everywhere, and he must
also have known that the “confessions” had done more for its
dismemberment and final dissolution than anything else; then
why did he attempt to play into its expiring hands, against
public sentiment and justice, when the imputed but misnamed
crime of publication was done in New Orleans, La., and the
author, who had only committed the “confessions” to paper,
residing in Mississippi, and more especially while hundreds
were satisfied of the truth of the narrations? However, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
these revelations, the fact is made patent that wealth and a few
distinguished persons can wield mighty influences against reason
and justice; against common sense and the best interests
of society.</p>


<h3 id="IMPORTANT_INFORMATION">IMPORTANT INFORMATION GATHERED ABOUT THE BURIED TREASURE.</h3>

<p>The order of events will now be continued consecutively from
the time of the Sheriff giving bond and being released. Before
the opening of the city court he was left with thirty or forty
days to prepare for defense, during which time he visited Ocean
Springs and a few other watering places on the Mississippi
Sound, remaining a few days at Shieldsboro, now Bay St. Louis,
and there made acquaintance with old Mr. Toulme and two
other prominent gentlemen, who informed him that just after
the publication of Copeland’s confessions they took a copy of
said work, and made a visit out to Catahoula swamp, in that
county, in quest of the buried treasure referred to in the said
confessions as having been deposited there by the clan for safe
keeping. The map of this depository was lost during the
famous Harvey battle, near Red Creek, in Perry county. These
gentlemen informed him that they found the place as described
by Copeland, and that every tree and line of demarcation as
delineated in his description of the place could not have been
more accurately given. They stated that there were three
places of deposit, showing that in time there had been three
kegs buried, which, from every appearance, indicated as though
they might have been removed some eight or ten years prior to
that time. The old keg staves and iron hoops were still remaining,
and the perfect impress made by the burial of these
kegs still existed, with a grown lining of moss which time had
brought forth; on the whole exhibiting quite an antique appearance.</p>

<p>There has been much speculation and curiosity manifested
among many as to who was the fortunate person who found
this buried treasure. Let it be remembered that the Harvey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
battle occurred in some part of the year 1848. The description
and mystic map of the place in connection with this treasure
was lost in the time of this battle. Until the “confessions”
were published in 1858 the public knew nothing about the
buried money, but when they come out curiosity and opinion
ran to an extensive height. Now this information was given to
the Sheriff by one living in that section of country when the
collision happened. He told him that a few days after the
“battle” he found an instrument of writing which he could
neither read nor in any way understand, and the same with all
others around who saw it. To them it appeared more of a
wonder and “puzzle fool” than anything else. He kept it by
him for the sake of holding something partaking of mystery
and curiosity. But having business some short time after in
the city of Mobile, Ala., he carried this mystic paper along
with him to this place. While there one evening on the streets
he met with some of his former acquaintances. Thinking that
this curiosity would amuse, he exhibited it for common inspection,
and while examining and discussing the same, one by
the name of George A. Cleaveland came up to peep, and requested
to examine more minutely, when, after looking for a
while, he folded it up in a very careless manner which then
found a place in his pocket, remarking at the same time that
it did not amount to much anyway, and walked off.</p>

<p>The person who brought this paper, not being aware of its
value, did not care enough about it to make any objections to
his carrying it away with him.</p>

<p>But the new possessor, in all probability, fully understood
the mystic lines contained in it, and soon turned them to signal
account. From rather a pecuniary condition of embarrassment
at the time, as the Sheriff has been informed, he very soon
afterward made an advertisement through the public journals
of the city, expressing a desire to purchase twenty able-bodied
negroes and the like number of mules and drays, all of which
he bought accordingly in a short time afterward, and more; and
from that time to the day of his death remained independent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
all the while increasing rapidly in wealth and external prosperity.</p>

THE TRIAL.</p>
<p class="center">
SIMPLE AND UNADORNED TRUTH STRUGGLING WITH ALL THE FORCES<br>
OF TALENT, WEALTH AND PROPPED UP FALSEHOOD—THE CONVICTION<br>
ONLY A VICTORY IN NAME FOR THE PROSECUTION,<br>
BUT IN REALITY A LASTING TRIUMPH FOR THE DEFENCE.</p>
<h3>
PRELIMINARY REMARKS TOUCHING THE TRIAL.</h3>


<p>An error—a fault in the working of a machine, or in physical
operations generally, is soon discovered and admits of very
little discussion, as to whether all is right or something wrong.
Too much friction, a cog broken, or some other mechanical defect
in mechanical construction, and the machine will soon
stop; and so of physical movements; a disease or some radical
defect in the constitution is soon discovered by bad pains
and bad health; and if no recuperative remedy can be applied,
the consequence will soon be a death stoppage. But in the
moral world, the difficulties are far greater and more extensive.
Immaculate truth and unmixed error are soon acknowledged,
but when deeply blended together, ages may elapse
before any considerable or healthy progress can be made. In
physical science, and in mechanical discoveries, the progress
has been prodigious; but it is a question very much open to
dispute, whether the world is now purer, better, and happier
than it was three thousand years ago, notwithstanding the
centuries of statesmanship and legislation. In <em>physical</em> realities,
all appear to hail improvement with a welcome satisfaction,
and gladly receive truthful discoveries, no matter from
where they come, as if immediately experiencing a direct and
general interest in all such demonstrations; but it is far more
complicated in moral phenomena. Effects, either for good or
evil, require a longer time for development, and are subject to
influences from far more numerous and intricate causes, less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
capable of demonstration, and less capable of determining the
share each exercises in the production of compound effects.
Two persons may be equally honest, equally able, and equally
desirous for the common good of the nation; but they will
hotly dispute as to the proper means to be applied for this end;
but if the opinions or theories of each could be immediately
put to the test, and the results at once seen as in mechanical
operations, a very different state of society would soon exist.
If we could have a process of analyzation in moral transactions,
so as to make the deformities of separated error at once
manifest, and so with respect to the beauties of immortal
truth, we might indulge a well grounded hope for rapid conquests
toward the perfection of mankind.</p>

<p>Differences in organizations and in education, with vast extensions
of clashing interest; these, when properly directed,
may be rather a blessing than otherwise; but when allowed to
run into the wildest excesses without any restraint whatever,
the evils must be frightful in the train of consequences. The
excessive philanthropist is on for freedom, and will sacrifice
every other consideration for the success of his ardent object,
regardless of the reacting forces of despotism. The creature
of inordinate ambition does not stop to consider who is right
and who wrong—down with every obstacle in his way, that has
a tendency to impede his ultimate design. The theological
devotee prefers his own denomination to all others—his own
all right—the rest all mixed up with much objectionable error.
The individual who has made so much wealth, and attained to
so great a height of pecuniary prosperity by means, no matter
whether fair or foul, desires no change, even though it may be
for the benefit of tens of thousands—his own individual or
conventional interest will have more value in his estimation
than the interests of united millions in conflict. Generally,
those who have risen to honors, distinctions, and emoluments
by the vicious elements in society, will spare no exertions
which talent and wealth can command for the perpetuation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
the same circumstances of public wrongs. But, it is true,
where there are freedom of thought and action, public vices
cannot accumulate beyond a limited extent before conflicting
interests and passions will bring on the appropriate or temporary
remedy; yet the victors not unfrequently, ere long, run
into as wild excesses as their erring but fallen predecessors!
so then it would appear that revolutions only amount to a
change from one sort of excesses to another equally as pregnant
with evils. Yet in spite of all these apparently vain and
oscillating circumstances, there are underlying movements at
work in the nature of occult causes driving on nations to either
dissolution or a better and more enduring form of government.</p>

<p>If a government is so defective that it cannot sufficiently
protect life and property; if its conduct is so fickle and uncertain
as to destroy confidence and stability in the future,
convulsion, decay, and death must inevitably come if the organic
abuses are too great to admit of any other remedy.</p>

<p>Untempered liberty is worse than despotism; it is barbarism—might
reigns and not right. All the passions of licentiousness
are let loose, and the many weak are lawful prey for
the few strong.</p>

<p>The idea which commonly prevails as regards frequency of
elections being the effective remedy for all abuses of government,
though plausible, is sophistry and the height of fallacy
according to the lessons which experience have taught. It is
all very easy and fine to contend for short terms of elections—all
very captivating to contend that if one officer well performs
his duty, he can either retire into private life with all the grateful
honors of his country, or, for meritorious services, he can
be re-elected for another term, all of which is the most powerful
incentive to do right, and, at the same time, the most
formidable barrier against intentional wrong. But what does
experience loudly proclaim? “For the short term you will be
in office, make all you can, scruple at nothing, laugh justice in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
the face, trample on the principles of rectitude, and you will be
admired in the present and immediate future only as a consummate
political trickster which may, without shame, be imitated
by other succeeding actors. But if you mean to be honest,
and tender of just rights and claims, with a desire for the common
good of your country in rewarding meritorious services
and encouraging the sources of true national prosperity, you
will only be laughed at for your folly.” These constant elections,
as it were, open the store-houses for a general scramble,
for a wordy warfare of frothy declamation, for abuse and misrepresentation
of all the nobler traits of human nature—making
virtue a crime and fashionable vices respectable. The most
expert in business of this sort, are generally the successful
ones in the contest. Before the excitement of one election is
over, another more intense begins. Under present circumstances,
no one can calculate with any reasonable probability
of continuance of the present form of government beyond a
period of four years while there is no security for keeping wild
and inflamed passions within proper bounds.</p>

<p>Correct public sentiment, when free to choose, is apt to have
a government of the same nature. Is it public sentiment that
forms the character of government, or government which forms
the character of public sentiment? Both of these considerations
may be true. It is quite possible to conceive how a few
intelligent and well-meaning persons, commanding a sufficiency
of power, can improve the character of a nation; and under
other circumstances, <i lang="la">vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>We want a government sufficient to restrain the strong and
protect the weak. We want a government competent to make
good laws, and strong enough to execute them. We want a
government determined to protect life and property, so that industry
can be encouraged, and a confidence in the permanent
stability of it maintained. We want a government that will
purify the bar, and give a judiciary of competency and integrity
such as will grace and adorn the bench for “its disposition to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
do justice to all.” We want a government resolved to inflict
punishment and stamp with enduring disapprobation any league
or infamous association for the triumph of crime, no matter how
distinguished or wealthy its members may be.</p>

<p>The particulars of the trial now to be given, is a striking illustration
of the league for the triumph of wrong, in which not
only the executive heads of several States were concerned, but
also other high officials in power, with more of distinguished
persons in different capacities.</p>

<p>As the caption states, their triumph was only in name. The
retribution of truth and justice is sometimes tardy in execution;
but, longer or shorter, it is sure to come. Nearly fifteen years
have elapsed, since this trial terminated, and the public has
remained uninformed to this day of the more important features
connected with it. This long silence has favored the continuance
of wealth, power, and the honors of office for the prosecutors;
while the defendant was unjustly brought to the verge
of ruin by the enormous expenses attending the trial. The
phases are now being changed—one side going out and the
other coming in—one recovering strength and the other experiencing
decline and fall with reference to the future—consequences
which should <em>immediately</em> have followed the trial, for
if justice could be forthwith done without so much expense
and delay, the evil perpetrators would soon come to an end;
or, at least, would soon become diminished in numbers.</p>

<p>As stated in another place, the interval betwixt the times of
giving bond and trial amounted to near forty days. One
part of this interval was devoted to making preparations for
trial; the other part was consumed in visiting on the coast with
a view to gather such information as might be of interest afterwards.
The information as to the discovery of the place of
deposited money in Catahoula swamp is one link in the chain
of circumstances which attest the truth of the “confessions;”
another is the finding of the mysterious map in a few days
after the famous Harvey battle, which is in perfect agreement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
with another part of the said confessions, together with the
singular circumstances in connection, which were the means of
George A. Cleaveland getting possession of the map, with
other subsequent circumstances showing the strongest of probability
that he not only understood it, but also succeeded in
getting the buried gold from Catahoula swamp.</p>

<p>But the opening of the city court and the time for trial
were near at hand, and the sheriff or defendant, had to
leave the coast hurriedly to repair forthwith to Mobile.
He arrived there some two or three days prior to the opening
of court. He there found considerable anxiety and
excitement prevailing on the subject. A number of collected
friends from distant parts of Mississippi were there to be present
and hear the trial, which was the general theme of conversation
and speculation everywhere. Fortunate for the
defendant, he arrived in time to summon quite a number of important
witnesses, who were accidently in the city from various
points on the line of the Mobile &amp; Ohio railroad attending a
railroad meeting. DeKalb, Kemper county, was well represented
in this meeting. The delegates from this town all being
men of moral worth and of superior intelligence; J. H. Gully,
P. H. Gully, H. C. Rush, A. B. Campbell, Cornelius McLamore,
and the illustrious J. S. Hamm, then presiding judge of his
district, all from the above named place. In DeKalb, S. S.
Shoemake had resided for a number of years, and these gentlemen
from the same place were very valuable as witnesses in
the estimation of the defendant; and, of course, he had them
summoned without delay right on the ground.</p>


<h3 id="THE_RECORD_OF_THE_TRIAL">THE RECORDS OF THE TRIAL FROM THE CITY COURT OF MOBILE.</h3>

<p>The Clerk of the City Court of Mobile has twice been applied
to for particulars, or for a copy of the records of the trial.
In his first reply the present Clerk freely confesses the records
of the case to be misty, suspicious, deranged, and altogether
unsatisfactory, without venturing any further opinion on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
matter. In his second reply he confesses in still stronger terms,
if possible, of the confusion of the records; important papers
not on file; much missing; more deranged, and very hard, with
any amount of application of labor to make anything of value
intelligible for rigid comprehension—one case, Shoemake’s,
entirely disappearing from the docket, and no circumstances or
account left to show the cause for the same.</p>

<p>In substance, here follows an extract from the Clerk’s replies:
“I find by the Clerk’s indorsement, that in the November term,
1858, the Grand Jury found bills for four cases of libel against
J. R. S. Pitts, and four indictments were framed accordingly in
the same term. They are found docketed, numbers 61, 62, 63
and 64, to be prosecuted severally by G. Y. Overall, C. F.
Moulton, G. A. Cleaveland and S. S. Shoemake. There are four
appearance bonds for six hundred dollars each, dated January
25, 1859. The writ of arrest is dated January 15, 1859. But
the indictments are all missing. There is nothing here on file
or on record showing any action of either the Governor of
Alabama or the Governor of Mississippi with respect to the
processes for arrest. The case number 64 has entirely disappeared,
and no trace left to account for the same. In the February
term, 1859, the trial of J. R. S. Pitts commenced on the
23d, continued through the 24th, and on the 25th was given to
the jury, who on the 2d day of March rendered a verdict imposing
a penalty of fifty dollars, to which finding the Court
further ‘ordered that the defendant be imprisoned in the common
jail of the county for the space of three months, and on
the non-payment of the fine and costs that he be further imprisoned
until discharged according to law.’ The case tried
must have been that of Overall, 61, the papers of which have
entirely disappeared, as I cannot find them on file. The two
remaining cases, numbers 62 and 63, were continued from term
to term until February 28, 1863, when a forfeiture of bond was
taken against the defendant and his sureties, Colin McRae and
James H. Daughdrill, and then continued through several terms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
to 21st of March, 1864, when judgment final was entered, and
execution issued, which execution was ordered to be returned
by the Commissioners of Revenue on the payment of all costs,
the costs being paid by said Daughdrill said execution was returned.
The matter remained in this condition until January,
1867, when the defendant and his sureties were finally released
by the Commissioners of Revenue.</p>

<p>“The names of the Petit Jury who tried the case are Wm. B.
Hayden, James B. Post, George Mason, George M. Brower,
Edward Guesnard, John R. McBurney, W. H. Marchan, Henry
T. Eatman, Walter L. Young, Benjamin F. Hunt, John A.
Bevell and Wm. H. Vincent. The only witnesses I can find
any record of are the prosecutors for themselves. The attorneys
for the prosecution were R. B. Armstead, solicitor, and
Anderson &amp; Boyle, while Manning and Walker appeared to
have conducted the defense.</p>

<p>“Imperfect as this history of the case is, it has cost me much
search and labor to collect from the disconnected, confused
and garbled materials left me for reference. The whole affair
is a myth.”</p>


<h3 id="COMMENTS_ON_THE_RECORDS">COMMENTS ON THE RECORDS.</h3>

<p>This communication from the City Clerk of Mobile is valuable
in more points than one. In another place he states that
there is in his office on file an affidavit from Shoemake relative
to the prosecution. The nature and subject of this affidavit
was not inserted in the Clerk’s communication. Why this affidavit
of Shoemake’s as one of the prosecutors, and none to be
found from any of the other three prosecutors, is a profound
mystery. Again, affidavits before Grand Juries, in connection
with prosecution for libel, surpasses ordinary comprehension.
The missing of so many papers, and the derangement of all
others, might be charged to the neglect or carelessness of the
custodian, the then Clerk, but how can the legerdemain disappearance
of Shoemake’s name from the trial docket be accounted
for? No reasons—no cause for the same can be found!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
The present Clerk is bewildered, and can give no explanation
on the matter. Such being the case, is it not reasonable to
presume that the leaders of the prosecution then controlled the
files and records of the office to suit convenience? Prosecution
foul in the commencement needs props, subterfuges and mystery
in every stage of progress.</p>

<p>But the most impenetrable darkness of all is, Shoemake’s
name being found on the trial docket as one of the prosecuting
parties. The order in which they stand on the docket is cases
number 61, 62, 63 and 64, corresponding with which the prosecutors
are G. Y. Overall, C. F. Moulton, G. A. Cleaveland and
S. S. Shoemake; and in agreement with the same, four appearance
bonds are found. The question now for solution is, did
Shoemake really get a bill from the Grand Jury of Mobile at
the November term, 1858, along with the other three? The
files and records show that he did. Now let it be borne in
mind that this man was the agent to bear the requisition from
the Governor of Alabama to the Governor of Mississippi for
the arrest of J. R. S. Pitts. Let it also be borne in mind that
J. R. S. Pitts is positively certain that he never gave any bond
to cover the case of Shoemake—only three, Overall, Moulton
and Cleaveland’s; and that before receiving the Clerk’s communication,
he never knew that Shoemake was one of the
docketed prosecutors; but he did learn during the time of his
trial, that Shoemake tried to get a bill in the February term,
1859, and signally failed. Choose either end of the dilemma
and the difficulty is not at all obviated. If he did get a bill, the
rascality is equally manifest. To go to Mobile, Ala., to prosecute
while he was a resident of Mississippi, and J. R. S. Pitts
also a resident of this State, is utterly incomprehensible in any
other light than a flagrant outrage on every principle of law
and justice. If he did not get a bill, the files and records show
forgery of the darkest hues. So, then, from whatever stand-point
the whole affair is viewed, atrocity and corruption of the
most aggravated character stare the impartial inquirer in the
face from every direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>As before seen, the trial opened on the 23d of February,
1859. The indictments were for libel in three cases as the defendant
understood the same. The prosecutors, first, G. Y.
Overall; second, C. F. Moulton, and the third, G. A. Cleveland.
As it had been previously arranged by them on the State
docket, the defendant had first to answer the charge of G. Y.
Overall. Had he been placed the last on the docket, the prosecution
would have, in all probability, signally failed in every
case; and even this first case, with all the deep-laid designs in
connection, would have been a failure but for the extraordinary
resources for the forcing of a verdict by foul means.</p>

<p>The design here contemplated is only to give a brief abstract
of the more momentous features of the trial, because the whole
given, would be inopportune in a condensed work of this
nature.</p>


<h3 id="SHOEMAKE_AND_B_TAYLOR_IN_COURT">SHOEMAKE AND B. TAYLOR IN COURT.</h3>

<p>As before noticed in another part of this work, S. S. Shoemake
will again be introduced as playing a very conspicuous
part, not only on trial, but also before the Grand Jury, which
was organized for the then present term of the City Court.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the “records” to the contrary, the following
information was given to the defendant, at the time of his
trial, by one of the jurors himself. Shoemake, although an
old resident of Mississippi, the defendant also a resident of
the same State, and the work complained of published in New
Orleans, Louisiana, yet he, with audacity enough, went before
the said Grand Jury to get another bill for libel in favor of
himself and against the defendant, but was sadly disappointed.
This Grand Jury had had more time for thought and reflection
than the preceding one, and peremptorily refused his application.
Had he been unjustly injured, his redress would have
been from the juries of Mississippi; but he had penetration
enough not to make any efforts of this nature in Mississippi,
well knowing that his character was too well-known here to succeed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
in making juries subservient to his dark purposes of
crime and dissimulation.</p>

<p>On the day of trial, the counsel for the defence availed himself
of the earliest opportunity to make application for further
time, on the grounds of absence of material testimony, but
without the desired effect; the Court over-ruled the application,
and both sides were ordered to proceed to trial instanter.</p>

<p>While the Sheriff of this court was calling in witnesses
for the prosecution, the name of Bentonville Taylor was particularly
noticed by the defendant. This man, as was afterward
learnt, had been conveyed by the clan from Williamsburg,
Mississippi, and appeared quite unexpected on the part of the
defence. His knowledge about the case then pending, could
have been but very little or nothing at all, and was evident to
all who were more conversant with the facts, that his presence
there was not in behalf of justice, but for sordid objects of
pecuniary gain.</p>

<p>The first witness brought to the stand by the prosecution
was S. S. Shoemake. He came up with an air of boldness and
majesty not easily described. Calm, deliberate, and with an
external appearance of the perfect gentleman, he gave his testimony
with elegance and beauty of language, almost sufficient
“to deceive the very elect.” His testimony, such as it was,
was pretty much confined to a pretended conversation betwixt
the defendant and himself during the journey together while
under circumstances of arrest; to the effect that the defendant
had confessed to him that the names given in the life of Copeland,
were not at all reliable, and that the authenticity of the
work was entirely valueless. This pretended conversation was
wholly a concocted fabrication of his own to serve the ends of
the prosecution. But the character of this man in a few more
minutes elicited, will satisfy the reader as to what amount of
credit his testimony was worth.</p>

<p>His then uninterrupted evidence being given, the next ordeal
was his cross-examination by the counsel for the defence. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
envelope alone, which at first contained the John R. Garland
letter, was handed to him with this question asked: “Did you
address this envelope?” After looking at it for a while he
answered: “I believe this to be my hand-writing.” He was
next asked if he had at any previous time addressed a letter or
communication of any sort to the Sheriff of Perry county,
Mississippi. He answered that he had no recollection whatever
of addressing a letter to the Sheriff of Perry county,
Mississippi, who was then seated at the bar before the Court.
The John R. Garland letter itself was next handed to him,
with the request to state to the Court and Jury if he was the
writer of said letter, which had been written and mailed at
DeKalb, Mississippi. Here Shoemake hesitated and faltered
considerably; and, in a moment, seemed to be fully conscious
of the complete wreck before him. A transition so sudden
from the heights of promising success to the most forlorn and
abject condition of reverse, was too much for him to surmount.
In this instance, he manifested a great reluctance to, or desire
to evade giving a direct answer, but being forced by the Court
to give a definite reply, he answered at last with emphatic
words that he was not the writer or author of the John R.
Garland letter. Now, for the succeeding and successful conflicting
testimony.</p>

<p>The witnesses who had been previously summoned, were
now called forth to testify to the hand-writing of the John R.
Garland letter, as well as to the general character of S. S. Shoemake,
as to whether or not his being a man of truth and veracity.
After examining the letter, several of them expressed,
according to the best of their knowledge, that the hand-writing
was S. S. Shoemake’s; and also, from his general character,
they could not believe him on oath. But another witness
called for and introduced, Cornelius McLamore, gave still
stronger and more decisive testimony. No man could have
had greater facilities for thoroughly understanding all about
Shoemake than Cornelius McLamore. He, without any doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
whatever declared the hand-writing to be, undoubtedly, S. S.
Shoemake’s, and that he for another could not believe him on
oath.</p>


<h3 id="MLAMORE_FELL_A_VICTIM">M’LAMORE FELL A VICTIM TO THE VENGEANCE OF THE CLAN.</h3>

<p>This is the same gentleman treated of in another place, who
so mysteriously disappeared the evening after the trial, and,
from that time to the present, has never more been heard of.
Whatever fate he met with, no one has ever been able to tell;
but from all the circumstances connected, it must be almost
certain to the thinking mind of all that he was cruelly murdered
by the conspiring clan, who had so long maintained a
sad career of blood and revenge, with all the practiced modes
of concealment.</p>

<p>The following is an extract from a letter dated DeKalb, May
21st, 1871, written by a prominent gentleman and ex-Sheriff
of the county in which the town of DeKalb is situated:</p>

<p>“There has never been any person living in the county by
the name of John R. Garland. Mr. McLamore has never been
heard of since the time he was a witness in your case, during
the month of February or March, 1859.”</p>

<p>Two powerful motives predominated for the termination of
his existence. The first, the unrelenting revenge for the crushing
defeat he gave to others, and particularly to Shoemake while
on the witness-stand. And secondly, to prevent an indictment
for perjury against Shoemake; for it will be remembered that
he swore positively to the hand writing of Shoemake, who had
immediately before denied the same on oath in open court.
These two considerations, together with having just sold his
cotton, the money for which he had then in his possession, will
account for his presumptive murder. No one could better
understand the hand writing of Shoemake than Cornelius McLamore,
for, as the defendant has been authoritatively informed,
the former was during some time book-keeping for the
latter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>


<h3 id="G_Y_OVERALL_PROVES_AN_ALIBI">G. Y. OVERALL PROVES AN ALIBI</h3>

<p>Shoemake, the first witness for the prosecution, had made
such a wretched failure that no efforts were made to bring in
the other witness from Mississippi of the same character, Bentonville
Taylor. The prosecution next introduced two witnesses
from Columbus, Miss., and one by the name of G. W.
Overall, all to prove an alibi, and that G. Y. Overall was positively
residing in another place at the time referred to in Copeland’s
confessions. This testimony was satisfactory and unobjectionable;
but, as will be shown in further progress of the
trial, did not in reality invalidate the confessions in any material
point whatever.</p>

<p>The examination and cross examination of the different witnesses,
with the arguments of the opposing counsel, occupied
the Court for about two days; and had G. Y. Overall’s object
been nothing further than the establishing of his own innocence,
he might have succeeded commensurate with his own
unbounded desire; but what was he doing associated with such
men as S. S. Shoemake and Bentonville Taylor? The complete
unmasking of the infamous conduct of the former was
anything but auspicious for the prosecution, and left a very
unfavorable impression on all who heard the proceedings as to
the character of the prosecution.</p>


<h3>THE ARGUMENTS FROM BOTH SIDES.</h3>

<p>The closing of the testimony was immediately followed by
the opening arguments of the solicitor for the prosecution,
which continued for a considerable length of time. Next the
argument of Hon. Percy Walker, for the defense, which occupied
a period of two hours and a half in delivery. Distinguished
as he had heretofore been on all occasions, this, as
was said by his friends, was one of the greatest and happiest
efforts he ever made. At the time the court-room was crowded
almost to suffocation, and outside of it thousands were congregated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
to catch the utterances from his flowing lips. His withering
torrents against Shoemake electrified the court; but his
main argument went to show that G. Y. Overall had no right
to prosecute in the name of G. Overall, and that it was another
person referred to in Copeland’s confessions.</p>

<p>The prosecution replied; and now the arguments from both
sides being finished, the written notes from each, together with
instructions from the Court were furnished to the jury, and it
forthwith retired to its room for the purpose of trying to agree
on a verdict. But it was soon ascertained that there was a
very strong probability of it not coming to any agreement at
all. After retirement for about twenty-four hours without
any harmonious result, it reported to the Court the almost
certainty of not being able to render any verdict on the case
pending before it.</p>


<h3 id="THE_COURT_AND_THE_JURY">THE COURT AND THE JURY.</h3>

<p>Upon the reception of said report, the Judge made some
changes in his former charges to the effect that if doubt existed,
the Jury must give the defendant the benefit of such
doubt; further adding, that he should not discharge until the
rendering of its verdict; and at once ordered it to retire again,
with additional information that if it required any explanation
on any points of law involved in the case before it, to report
accordingly to the Court, and it would give the proper
instructions sought for. After the Jury had remained some
day or two longer in retirement, the Court ordered it to report,
on the arrival of which, the Court desired to know the points
of disagreement. In answer, one of the jurors, W. L. Young,
rose and respectfully addressed the Court, stating that a majority
of the Jury entertained doubts; and as for himself, he
had conscientious scruples as to the propriety of confounding
G. Overall and G. Y. Overall together; while, at the same time,
the principal part of the Jury did not believe that when Copeland
gave the name that he intended it for G. Y. Overall, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
that the latter had no proper authority for accepting the name
of G. Overall, as published in the confessions. The presiding
Judge appeared to be well pleased with the manly and intelligent
conduct of the young gentleman, but informed him at the
same time that the Jury must be governed according to the
law and evidence before it. To this declaration, Mr. Young
made the following reply: “Please your Honor, and suppose
we do not believe the evidence in the case before us.” This
ready, but profound reply excited, to all appearance, a pleasant
smile on the Judge’s countenance, and created no little sensation
throughout the court-room among the legal fraternity,
some of which were heard to exclaim—“a pretty good lawyer
himself.” The Judge, feeling the weight of such an expression,
did not attempt any further remarks in reply for this
time.</p>


<h3 id="TAMPERING_WITH_THE_JURY">TAMPERING WITH THE JURY.</h3>

<p>The jury once more retired. The court kept furnishing fresh
charges in opposition to the first given; the last of which was
so pointedly as to declare in positive terms that according to
the law and evidence it, the jury, was compelled to find a verdict
for the prosecution! Six long days and nights had this jury
remained in confinement. Worn out by it and with excessive
loss of rest, together with no hope of immediate relief, as the
judge had declared his intention to keep it in strict confinement
for an indefinite period, unless a verdict could sooner be returned;
all these miseries endured, and in prospect to be endured,
forced the jury at last to a verdict against its better
judgment by the understanding or impression artfully made that
it would be better to get liberty by agreeing to a verdict with
a small amount of fine in the way of damages for G. Y. Overall,
but had not the most distant idea of any imprisonment resulting.
But the judge better knew the law which invested him
with power to imprison for six months, but in this instance he
sentenced only for three months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>In addition to the torturing process resorted to for the purpose
of forcing a verdict from the jury in its last hours of
confinement, other shameful means were made use of by outsiders
of a tampering nature—such as the conveyance of notes
and packages in bottles to that part of the jury in favor of the
prosecution—one end of the string tied to the bottle, and the
other end, in the form of a ball, thrown through the window to
be received by the parties intended. The nature of these notes
and packages could only be conjectured—the recipients themselves
holding the contents a perfect secret within their own
little circles. This information was conveyed to the defendant
by eye-witnesses and part of the jury.</p>


<h3 id="SYMPATHY_AND_REGRET_AS_EXPRESSED_BY_SEVERAL_JURORS">SYMPATHY AND REGRET AS EXPRESSED BY SEVERAL JURORS.</h3>

<p>After the sentence was announced, Dr. Bevell and others,
who formed a part of the jury, openly declared that if they had
been aware of the fact that the judge had the power to imprison,
suffering as they were, never would they have consented
to a verdict in favor of the prosecution. Another distinguished
juror, W. L. Young, on the case, on seeing the
defendant coming from the court-room, met him with all the
warmth of genuine friendship and the most sincere of emotion,
sympathy, and contrition, which will be best understood in his
own words: “My dear sir, my feelings are deeply wounded, and
I feel as though I have committed a very great wrong in giving
consent against my better judgment—a wrong even to fine you
so much as one single cent, and were the case to be done over
again, with the light now before me, I would most assuredly
act quite differently, for I now see my great error, though my
greatest grief is that this lesson was taught too late to be of any
service to you in your present humiliated situation.” The
reply was suitable, and in these words: “Permit me, sir, to acknowledge
your truly sympathetic manifestations with all the
welcomeness and gratitude which are possible to be expressed;
and also to further express to you that notwithstanding this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
heavy stroke of adversity, I will endeavor to bear the same with
philosophical fortitude, under the strengthening conviction that
this is the most memorable epoch of life, and in spite of malignant
persecution, justice will afterwards be done, and time will
bring forth its appropriate reward.”</p>


<h3 id="FAILURE_OF_PETITION">FAILURE OF PETITION—RECEIVES THE KINDEST TREATMENT WHILE
IN PRISON.</h3>

<p>Immediately after the sentence, the citizens of Mobile prepared
and sent a petition to His Excellency, Governor Moore,
of the State of Alabama, containing the signatures of over six
hundred of the best citizens of Mobile, praying for the release
of the defendant, but the Governor declined to grant the request
because the petition was not signed by the presiding
judge.</p>

<p>But the sheriff of the city, Hon. James T. Shelton, must not
be overlooked. His conduct in behalf of the defendant was
noble and magnanimous in the extreme. All that one man
could do to alleviate the rust and monotony of confinement,
was gracefully and cheerfully done by him. His friendship—his
whole-souled treatment reached to an extent not to be surpassed
by any. Hospitalities at his own mansion in profusion,
a separate parlor well furnished with books of every description,
and in everything else well fitted up in the utmost order
of elegance and taste; no restraint whatever, beyond what the
law required—having the whole limits, for exercise and recreation,
of the prison boundaries; all such conveniences and comforts
were freely and lavishly bestowed; and for which a lasting
gratitude is due to the memory of the departed James T.
Shelton.</p>

<p>Numerous other visitors, of both sexes, came to render all
the comfort which humanity could afford. These visits were
sincere, friendly, and consoling, indeed; in short, everything
which could be done to remove dullness and make the time
glide away agreeably, was done with cheerfulness and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
truly natural fervor of heart. Time did not hang heavily; but
passed away briefly—a time which can now be referred to with
pride and satisfaction.</p>


<h3>THE CLAN GROVELLINGLY PENETRATES PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS.</h3>

<p>The defendant, at the time of his arrest, was engaged to be
married on the 22d of March following, to Miss Julia Pauline
Bowen, daughter of Rev. P. P. Bowen, of Ocean Springs, Miss.,
but having become entangled in severe law difficulties, the appointed
time for the consummation of this engagement was,
from necessity, indefinitely prolonged. During this time, and
more especially while confined in prison, the fact of such engagement
became generally known. Malicious propensities
could not be gratified enough by what had already been done,
and by the little persecution then enduring, but the baneful
malignity even extended to private and domestic arrangements.
Some one in Mobile, over the signature of Amogene Colfax,
addressed quite a lengthy communication to Miss Bowen.
This communication pretended to have emanated from a female
friend, the real object of which was evidently to poison and
prejudice the mind to an extent sufficient to mar the existing
engagement, and finally to break up all further considerations
of the matter with a view to bring on a reaction of public prejudice
to take the place of public sympathy, which was then
running in favor of the defendant. But few have any adequate
conception of the heights and depths of infamy which the clan
could reach for the accomplishment of its infernal designs.
But in this instance all such designs proved signally abortive,
as will be satisfactorily understood by reading Miss Bowen’s
reply to a communication from the defendant while in prison.</p>

<p>It is very much to be regretted that the letter with the fictitious
signature of Amogene Colfax has been misplaced or lost.
Its appearance in this work would be valuable by the way of
giving some idea of the clan’s complicated machinations; however,
Miss Bowen’s reply will afford information enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
satisfy that she was far beyond the reach of influences which
contemplated the ruin of both. Piety, firmness and devoted
sincerity are conspicuous in every line of the reply. Let the
reader now judge for himself:</p>


<h3 id="MISS_BOWENS_LETTER">MISS BOWEN’S LETTER.</h3>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Ocean Springs, Miss.</span>, March 16, 1859.<br>
</p>

<p>
<em>J. R. S. Pitts, Esq., Mobile, Ala.</em>:<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Esteemed Friend</span>—Happy indeed am I to have the pleasure
of acknowledging the reception of your kind favor bearing date
12th instant, the contents of which are so consoling and
interesting that I feel entirely inadequate to the task of making
the properly deserving reply.</p>

<p>This is the first intelligence I have had from you by letter
since I heard of the last unfortunate results of your trial. Ever
since the reception of this sad news my mind has been a complete
wreck. Both mental and physical strength have visibly
declined under the pressure of contemplated burdens which you
had to bear; but the relief which this, your last letter, has
afforded is beyond the powers of description.</p>

<p>In the first stages every effort was made to conceal a wounded
heart, but in vain; the countenance of sorrow was too plainly
depicted to be mistaken by those around who are acquainted
with former cheerfulness. Laboring under pungent affliction
from the silent meditation of your melancholy situation, none
but myself can have any correct idea of the internal struggles
with which I was contending. Under such a compression of
the vital powers, earthly scenes had no charms for me; but the
wings of last night’s mail bore the glad tidings from you that
all is well, leaving you comfortably situated and cared for in
every respect, which affords me the most exquisite relief.
From gloom and despair to joy and hope, the transition was
rapid and sudden. The following from your pen affords a satisfaction
which words are incapable of representing:</p>

<p>“You will please give yourself no uneasiness of mind so far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
as regards my comfort and well-being. My friends here have
situated me as agreeably in every respect as I could possibly
have desired. Perfectly composed and resigned myself, I want
you to share the same, if possible, in a still higher degree.”</p>

<p>All of us, well knowing your entire innocence, deeply sympathize
with you; and, as for my own part, this ordeal has only
been a trial of my devotion—not knowing before the real depth
of affection, which is now more strengthened and indelibly
fixed on thee. <em>Fictitious signatures cannot avail, nor indeed
any other cunningly devised schemes for the interruption of
the peaceful concord which has so long been maintained between
us.</em></p>

<p>Even a brief narration of little ordinary simplicities may
sometimes be enjoyed by minds accustomed to higher ranges
of thought, and which frequently soar to loftier spheres of the
grander contemplations of nature’s wonderful works. Accordingly
you will be disposed to pardon anything which you
may here find apparently of a light and frivolous character.</p>

<p>There is nothing new in our village that could, I presume,
be of interest to you, unless accounts of frequent marriages
would have this effect. In affairs of this sort there has been
almost an epidemic. We have had quite an inclement change
in the weather for this season of the year. It is just now very
cold, lowering, and quite unpleasant indeed; but the joyous
cheerfulness manifested by the little birds indicate the early
dawn of spring.</p>

<p>There is a charming lovely little mocking bird that makes
frequent visits near my window—sings so sweetly, and seems
to enjoy life with the utmost fulness of felicity, so much so
that I am, in a doleful hour, sometimes inclined to envy the
happiness which I cannot at all times share myself. Its warbling
melodies echoing as they are wafted along on the zephyrs
of the morning and renewed again toward the evening shades,
sometimes excite peculiar reflections, which are very wrong to
indulge in. I ought to be content with my lot, though it may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
seem rather hard, yet, perhaps, all for the best. The dispensations
of Providence cannot be otherwise; and it is vain to repine
against what we do not understand sufficiently. It is true
my pathway has been interspersed with many difficulties and
heart-rending trials from my earliest childhood; and they seem
to still follow me up to the present day. But of what use to
murmur? He who has blessed me with innumerable favors will
do all things well. “He who has been with and comforted in
the sixth trouble, will not forsake in the seventh.”</p>

<p>I fear you will think me enthusiastic on the subject of religion,
but hope not. All written has been sincerely felt; and were
it not for the comfort of religion hardly one happy moment would
I enjoy. Oppressed and fatigued, I can go to Him who hath
said, “Come unto me and find rest for your wearied soul.”</p>

<p>The family desire a united remembrance to you. Pardon
error, and believe as ever,</p>

<h3 id="DR_BEVELLS_LETTER_TO_MISS_BOWDEN">DR. BEVELL’S LETTER TO MISS BOWDEN.</h3>

<p>This is, perhaps, the proper place for the insertion of Dr.
Bevell’s letter to Miss Bowen. It contains important matter of
a public nature, which will again have to be referred to in the
subsequent comments which are to follow. Let it be carefully
read:</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">April 12, 1859.</span><br>
</p>

<p>
<em>Miss J. P. Bowen, Ocean Springs, Miss.</em>:<br>
</p>

<p>Excuse me, an entire stranger to you, for the liberty and
freedom I take in addressing you. Although, personally, we
are unacquainted yet my sympathies are with you and your
unfortunate intended. I formed his acquaintance in Augusta,
Miss., while he was engaged in writing the confessions of Copeland—the
cause of his present unjust imprisonment. Although
he is in prison, and redeeming an unjust sentence, his friends
have not deserted him, as is too often the case, but visit him
regularly and inquire after his welfare with the greatest anxiety,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
and endeavor to administer to his every want and comfort.
His friends, though numerous previous to his trial, have
greatly increased in number since. We have made an effort
to limit his imprisonment through the pardoning power of
Governor Moore, by an article addressed to him in the shape
of a petition, with about six hundred signatures of the most
responsible citizens of Mobile; but in this we have failed, and,
to my deepest regret, he will have to serve his time out.</p>

<p>We first drew up a petition to Judge McKinstry, signed by
a respectable number of the jury, but hearing of his negative
declarations on the street, we declined honoring him with the
request.</p>

<p>Although we have failed in these efforts, the conduct of all
the opposing clique strongly indicate to my mind that the
principal stringent ruling is to gratify, and sustain, and retain
political influence. The opposing party have by no means
sustained itself to the world, notwithstanding the obtaining of
a forced verdict and fine in the pitiful sum of fifty dollars,
which the jurors are determined shall not come out of Colonel
Pitts’ pocket. The Colonel has the sympathy of the principal
citizens of Mobile; and, among that number, almost, if not
quite, the entire portion of the gentler sex; and as long as he
has those amiable creatures advocating his cause he is free
from all censure and harm. He was extremely unfortunate in
not being able to prove certain facts on his trial that have
since almost revealed themselves. I think myself they have
seriously regretted the past and present daily expositions.
Colonel Pitts is as comfortably situated as possible under the
circumstances. He has the entire liberty of the prison bounds,
with no restraint whatever on his person or actions—sharing
freely the hospitality of our inestimable Sheriff and family. He
has an excellent little parlor, well fitted up for convenience and
comfort.</p>

<p>I was one of the unfortunate jurors who tried the case, and
from my observations prior to, and during the progress of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
trial, in my humble opinion he met with strenuous ruling and
injustice. Yet he bore all with that fortitude and patience that
ever characterizes a truly good man; and, since his confinement,
appears to be composed and resigned to his fate. This has had
a tendency to influence a favorable impression in his behalf
among the citizens of Mobile. His friends in Mississippi, who
are very numerous, are very much incensed against the Court,
and manifested their indignation by public declarations in their
public newspapers. His greatest grief and mortification are in
your behalf. He suffers more on your account than he does
on his own. He has daily the fullest assurance and confirmation
of the kindest feelings of our best people. And what more
could he want? It is looked on as one of those misfortunes
incident in life that sometimes cannot be avoided honorably,
and the only chance is to brave the storm fearlessly until a
more congenial sun will burst forth to his advantage, which
will be better appreciated and enjoyed had he never been in
prison. I do hope you have firmness and decision enough to
fast adhere in adversity—spurning the advice of those who
would attempt to prejudice you against him. Sympathizing
with him under the clouds of misfortune, rejoicing with him in
prosperity, and yet be happy together; and may you both live,
not to exult, but witness the repentance of your enemies, is
the desire of your well wisher.</p>

to acknowledge and to reply to this valuable communication,
in which will be found some statements well worthy of record.</p>

<p>
<em>Dr. John A. Bevell, Mobile, Ala.</em>:<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:—I am in receipt of yours, bearing date 12th inst., and
sensibly feel the loss of suitable language for a correct expression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
of what is due for your inestimable favor. It has
been read with intense interest. It came at the opportune
moment when most needed, and contains matter which to me
is of the highest earthly treasure, and for which the ordinary
returns of gratitude are but a faint expression of the true estimation
entertained in my own mind.</p>

<p>To learn from one so competent to furnish correct information
of the easy and comfortable situation of my much esteemed
friend, Mr. P., is gratifying in the extreme. At first,
imagination had drawn pictures too darkly of him being immured
in solitary confinement where the cheering rays of solid
friendship could not penetrate. How agreeably I have been
disappointed. Your communication has completely dispelled
for the future all such illusory apprehensions. Friends numerous,
and sympathy not confined to narrow limits, with an
abundant plenty of everything else calculated to alleviate the
misfortunes of a temporary exile.</p>

<p>But allow me to confess to you that the recent trial, with its
apparently sad results, has with me in no wise made the slightest
change deleterious to the future interest and happiness of
my friend. Previous to this memorable event in his life, with
him I had pledged for an early approach to the hymeneal
altar, and was fully satisfied then that he was, in every respect,
worthy of such a pledge of confidence; and if his merit were
deserving the same in that day, they are certainly, in my opinion,
more so to day.</p>

<p>As yet I have not heard a single word uttered that does not
fully justify Mr. P’s action in giving publicity to the history of
Copeland. The public good of his country demanded such action
from him. Bearing in mind such circumstances, I could not,
with any degree of consistency, suffer myself for a moment to
be biased or influenced by out-siders, and, more especially, by
those who are violently antagonist against the author for doing
that which ought to be received by the public generally as a
great blessing to society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>You will please do me the kindness at your earliest convenience
to inform Mr. P. not to suffer himself to be in the least
troubled on my account, nor to entertain any doubt of my unswerving
constancy. In this respect, perhaps I am endowed
with as much stability as any, and as much as he can desire.</p>

<p>Although heretofore strangers, nevertheless, I hold to be
much indebted for the warm interest you have taken in behalf
of my friend, and indeed mutually so of both.</p>

<p class="right">
Very respectfully, etc.,<br>
<span style="margin-right: 1.5em;"><span class="smcap">J. P. Bowen</span>.</span><br>
</p>

<p>From every creditable source, profuse attentions had entered
through all avenues of the prison wall; and now the defendant’s
time for which he had been sentenced was about to expire,
preparations were immediately made to honor him with a “reception
committee” to greet him from the narrow limits to the
realms of liberty, where dwells the broad expanse of earth and
sky. Confinement had not corroded the soul’s finer parts; and
to show how devoid his mind was of every semblance of prejudice
or malignity, a brief extract from his address delivered on
that occasion when emerging from his sentence bounds, will be
read with some degree of interest.</p>


<h3 id="AN_EXTRACT_FROM_THE_SPEECH">AN EXTRACT FROM THE SPEECH OF THE DEFENDANT BEFORE THE
COMMITTEE.</h3>

<p>“Gentlemen, at this proud moment, the breath of liberty is
refreshing. From an incarceration so unjust, you welcome me
back to freedom with as much joy as I can possibly experience
myself at this instant of time. Rather as a very much persecuted
individual than a criminal do you this day consider me.
For this demonstration of your kindly sentiments, as well as on
all other occasions, my gratitude is tendered in profusion.
What is it that can not be endured while being surrounded with
friends so devoted and sincere? The reception you have seen
proper to give me, removes all doubts as to the manner I will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
met by other circles of my fellow beings. Well do I know how
hastily judgment is often pronounced without sufficiently
discriminating betwixt guilt and innocence. This morning
I leave the precincts of prison unconscious of any
wrong by me committed, but, on the contrary, am strongly
impressed with the convictions that I have materially served
my country by giving publicity to the career of a band of men
who, for years, held whole States in absolute terror. For this
I have suffered, but do not repine, because <em>time</em>, the great
friend of truth, must eventually triumph. From prison
I come not forth burning with vindictive or revengeful
feelings against any. Notwithstanding the wrongs endured,
I have passed in my own heart an act of amnesty so far as
private considerations are concerned, and whatever course may
be marked out for the future, only the public good will, in this
respect, afford me any interest for subsequent pursuit. To you,
and to other large bodies of respectable citizens of Mobile, for
petitioning the Governor for pardon, although a failure, yet
equally do I return thanks for the best of intentions as though
they had been perfectly successful.”</p>

<p>Immediately after his release, letters of condolence and congratulations,
from distant parts, and almost from every direction
poured in. One in particular from a friend in Gonzales, Texas,
will also be read with more than ordinary interest. Its spirit
and intention were to impel him forward to higher achievements
of fame and utility.</p>


<h3 id="A_LETTER_FROM_A_FRIEND">A LETTER FROM A FRIEND IN TEXAS AFTER DEFENDANT’S RELEASE.</h3>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Gonzales, Texas, Dec. 30, 1859.</span><br>
</p>

<p>
<em>Dr. J. R. S. Pitts, Medical College, Ala.</em>:<br>
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:—In the sunshine of prosperity, friends will
crowd around like bees on the honey-comb, but when the lowering
clouds of adversity appear, there are but few who will
not be found among the ranks of deserters, your case, however,
forms an exception to the general rule. You have been favored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
by the benign and exhilarating influences of fortune; and you
have also experienced the dark and bitter reverses with which
humanity is so often saturated. At one time, she has thrown
around you a joyous halo of felicity—at another time she has
forsaken you with a treacherous inconstancy; but amid all her
various phases of change which you have endured, the sympathy
and good-will of every honest heart has beat high in your
behalf. Your vile prosecutors succeeded by miserable subterfuges
of law, which involved you in serious pecuniary embarrassments,
and consigned you within the dreary walls of confinement,
but time is now doing justice both to you and to
them. You are mounting up into a brighter—a purer atmosphere
of public estimation, while they are descending as rapidly
into the dark abodes of eternal execration.</p>

<p>No one can feel more elated, or more disposed to congratulate
you on anything pertaining to your interest, happiness,
and success than myself; and certainly none more willing to
contribute at every opportunity all within the power of one
individual to your permanent gratification: how could it be
otherwise? I have known you long; a chain of unbroken
friendship has ever continued betwixt us; and more than all,
I am proud in the contemplation that I have had some share
in your early education.</p>

<p>Your attention is now directed towards the medical profession;
and here I can express a few words of encouragement
without acting derogatory to the principles of rectitude or
sincerity; for if thinking otherwise, most certainly would I
prefer the task of assisting at the risk of displeasing you.</p>

<p>The medical profession affords a fine scope for the developement
of every faculty belonging to the human soul. Man,
“the image of God,” is the most wonderful and complicated
machine in the universe. Here is the noblest of all subjects—vast,
boundless, and inexhaustible. Here is a theme on which
the finest geniuses of the world have been engaged: a theme
in connection with which the accumulation of intellectual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
wealth and constant progression have been marching onward
with giant strides from the commencement of man’s mundane
existence; yet but little hope—but little prospect of ever reaching
perfection; hence the encouragement for onward acquisition
for further triumphs of science.</p>

<p>Knowledge is valuable only in proportion to its applicability
for preventing or alleviating the sufferings of humanity; then
where is the avocation more adapted to better accord with this
sentiment than the medical profession? Of course, I exclude
all consideration in reference to the many quacks, empirics
and murderers, who assume the medical garb without the least
sign of internal qualification.</p>

<p>There is nothing in all the wide diversified forms of creation
that can give you such lofty conceptions of the attributes of
the Deity as the study of man: Life’s warm stream which
ramifies and circulates in processes so wonderful; the numerous
heterogeneous fluids which are secreted from it to answer
all the astounding purposes of systematical economy with the
nicest of all exactness; and all this by a “vital principle”
which none can define, but which serves very well to represent
our ignorance; the almost countless numbers of self-acting—self-propelling
powers, with multitudes of valves, hinges, joints,
all working in the grandest of earthly harmony; these are mechanical
operations which belong to the Deity, and mock the
proudest of all efforts in vain imitation. But what are these
in comparison to the human mind—this noble prerogative of
man? It is this which makes him the “lord of creation,” and
draws the broad line of distinction betwixt himself and the
lower order of creation. It is to this we are indebted for the
manifold wheels, springs and levers which carry society along;
in short the moral transactions of this revolving globe owe
their origin and continuance to its agency. The science of
medicine comprises a considerable knowledge of the whole.
To understand any one business well, we must have much information
on the relation of many. The study of causes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
effects of physical phenomena, as well as the faculties, sentiments,
and propensities of the human soul, are all within your
province. But without enlarging, enough has been written to
urge and animate you on in the work you have so well begun.”</p>

<p>The most remarkable action of any executive was that of
the Governor of Mississippi in giving assistance to the “clan”
in its expiring throes, whether intentionally or unintentionally,
is not material now to enquire. From this action
alone, but few are incapable of understanding, to some extent,
the influence which wealth and distinction can exercise in
cases, no matter how depraved they may be. This is only one
instance from incalculable numbers which might be adduced
where even the highest departments of State can be made
subservient to vitiated purposes.</p>


<h3 id="A_LETTER_TAKEN_FROM_THE_TRUE_DEMOCRAT">A LETTER TAKEN FROM THE “TRUE DEMOCRAT.”</h3>

<p>The following was published in the <cite>True Democrat</cite>, from the
pen of one of the ablest Judges in the eastern part of Mississippi,
shortly after the liberation of the defendant:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Editor</span>—We heartily sympathize with J. R. S. Pitts,
Sheriff of Perry county, and are deeply mortified at the yielding
course of our Governor in rendering him up a prisoner in
obedience to a requisition from the State of Alabama. We
look on this whole affair as being preposterous in the extreme.
To have the Sheriff of one of our counties forced to vacate his
office, temporarily, and to be taken like a common felon, and
carried to another State, and there be tried as a malefactor,
and for what? Why, for simply writing and publishing the
confessions of a notorious “land pirate,” one of a gang of
banditti that has till recently been a terror to the whole country
for a great many years. Such a course betrays a feebleness
of nerve on the part of his Excellency perfectly unpardonable
in the Executive.</p>

<p>The “Wages and Copeland Clan” have become as notorious
in portions of Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana and Texas, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
was the pirate and robber, John A. Murrell, and his clan. It
is well for Mr. Pitts that his friends volunteered to guard him
and protect him until he reached the city of Mobile in safety.</p>

<p>Talk about rendering him up on a requisition that claimed
him as a “fugitive from justice,” when the offence, if any, was
committed in this State, when he was a citizen of Perry
county, and Sheriff of the county at the time, and quietly at
home discharging the duties of his office. “Oh! shame, where
is thy blush?”</p>

<p>But we rejoice to learn that his prosecutors have failed to
hurt him. They may have forced him to draw heavily on his
purse to fee lawyers, pay tavern expenses, etc., but they have
not hurt his character. He stands to-day proudly vindicated
as a bold and efficient officer before an impartial and unprejudiced
public. Mr. Pitts is too well known in Mississippi
for the tongue of slander or the hand of the bitter persecutor
to injure him seriously. He is a native of Georgia—“to
the manner born.” He was reared and principally educated in
Mississippi. And right in the county where he was principally
raised, he was selected by a large majority of the citizens
of the county to serve them and the State in the high and responsible
office of Sheriff of the county; and that too when he
had barely reached his majority of years. The intelligent
citizens of Perry county elected him by their spontaneous suffrage
solely on account of his great moral worth and his superior
business qualifications.</p>

<p>The most amusing circumstance in the whole affair is, the
report industriously circulated that Mr. Pitts did not write
the book—that he is not scholar enough to write such a book.
The report refutes itself by its own palpable absurdity. Everybody
who is acquainted with Mr. Pitts knows that he is a fair
English scholar, and a very good writer. The book is a valuable
book; and it has done, and will do more to rid the country
of the clan it exposes than even the killing and hanging has
done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Pitts may congratulate himself as having done more
with his pen as an author than he did with the rope and gallows
as Sheriff. Much more might be said in vindication of this
persecuted gentleman, but this is deemed sufficient. Mr. Pitts
is a young man, and will, if he lives many years, work out a
character in high social position, and official position, too, if he
seeks it. From his beginning, I predict for him a brilliant
career in the future.</p>

<p class="right">
Very respectfully,<br>
<span class="smcap">Vindex</span>.<br>
</p>


<h3 id="THE_CHARACTER_OF_THE_PROSECUTOR">THE CHARACTER OF THE PROSECUTOR.</h3>

<p>The vile character of the prosecution is not yet sufficiently
understood. There is yet more to be developed. Enough has
already been brought to light to give some idea of Shoemake,
one of the main witnesses in the struggle to crush truth. Earth
was never trod by a more dangerous and despicable wretch
than this. He was the embodiment of all that was mean, cruel,
bloody and horrible. How much superior the other agent and
intended witness, Bentonville Taylor is, the reader will judge
for himself from the following authentic testimony.</p>

<p>The statement will be remembered in the commencing part
of the proceedings of the trial that no ordinary amount of astonishment
was experienced by the defendant when Bentonville
Taylor was called into court as one of the principal witnesses
for the prosecution. The defendant well knowing the
character of this man, he lost no time for getting the most substantial
of testimony touching his notorious reputation. This
testimony has been held in reserve up to the present period for
reasons which will be given presently.</p>

<p>In Shoemake’s evidence, the prosecution sustained such an
overwhelming defeat that it refrained from calling up another
of the same type for that time. As before stated, Bentonville
Taylor was brought from Williamsburg, Covington county,
Miss. The nature of his testimony, intended to be given in
court, was immediately learned afterward by his card published<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
in one of the Mobile newspapers. The substance of this card
was to the effect that the names given in the confessions were
forged by the defendant, and that Copeland himself was insane
at the time he made the confessions, and the same entirely unworthy
of any credit whatever either in public or private. It
was thought at the time that Bentonville Taylor was to be
used in the other two cases of Moulton and Cleaveland against
the defendant to be afterward tried. This is one reason why
the documents pertaining to Bentonville Taylor have so long
been withheld. Another is, it is always painful, in the absence
of imperative necessity, to make public such considerations as,
under other circumstances, might be better enveloped in silence;
but when charges of forgery have been made, and that the
whole confessions are entirely unworthy of credit, then it becomes
an absolute necessity to know something of the man
who has had the audacity to make such charges.</p>

<p>First will be given some extracts from a letter which was
intended for publication at the time, but on more mature
thought was decided to be suppressed for the same reasons as
just given. This letter is now in the hands of the defendant,
the severer parts of which will still be suppressed for humanity’s
sake:</p>

<p>“Who is this Bentonville Taylor, where did he come from,
and what his character as established by himself? It seems
he came to Ellisville, Jones county, Miss., about the time or
shortly after Copeland was brought from the Alabama penitentiary
to Mississippi to be tried for the murder of Harvey—pretending
then to be a Yankee school master seeking employment—having
with him a woman whom he introduced to that
community as his sister and assistant teacher. They obtained
a school; he and his sister took board in a respectable family
located in Ellisville, Mr. Parker’s. They had not been there
long before reports got out in this family of such a nature that
is perhaps improper to publish. However, Mr. Parker ordered
them to leave his house. The trustees of the school forthwith<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
called a meeting, which resulted in the discharge of both. They
were promptly paid off; the woman left for parts unknown,
while he has been loitering around in the adjoining counties
in a way anything but satisfactory, ever since. He got out a
license to plead law, defended Copeland in his last trial, and
then was brought from Williamsburg, Covington county, by
the Mobile prosecutors, to there serve their purposes, in the
most reduced of external condition and centless, but returned
in the finest suit of attire, with plenty of money in his pocket—the
rewards of his services in Mobile for falsehood and attempted
deception. And this is the respectable lawyer from
Mississippi, as represented by one of the prosecutors. A
cheaper and more degraded instrument could not have been
found in all Eastern Mississippi. A poor subterfuge to resort
to such a man to lie men out of deserving censure. How readily
it seems the prosecution knew where to place its fingers to subserve
the purpose. A few more such licks will nail the truth
of Copeland’s confessions to the cross forever.”</p>

and most respectable citizens of Jones county, about this

<p>After Bentonville Taylor returned from Mobile, I saw him

<p class="right">
[Signed.]&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="smcap">Edward W. Goff.</span><br>
</p>

<p>The next question to be dealt with is the miserable plea of
insanity, and forged names in the confessions.</p>

<p>First, let the report from the inquisition jury be read, which
will be found on <a href="#Page_113">page 113</a> of this work. Again, it is
well known by those who visited Copeland in person,
that there was a keenness and shrewdness about him which
distinguished him from ordinary men; and all the promptings
given to feign insanity did not amount to anything but deserving
failure. And as to the gratuitous charge of forging names,
the defendant did not know anything about them previous to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
being given by Copeland. He did not know that such names
were in existence before, and of course could not forge in the
absence of all knowledge appertaining; but the conduct of the
prosecution, with hundreds of living witnesses, go, as quoted
from the letter just referred to, “to nail to the cross forever
the truth of Copeland’s confessions.”</p>

<p>So much for the trial in Mobile in the first case, and now for
the necessary comments to further enable the reader to comprehend
the whole.</p>

<p>There were two other cases on the same docket of precisely
a similar nature to the first against the defendant. For two or
three years afterward he was in regular attendance, and always
ready for trial; but the prosecution would not allow either case
to come on until known that his presence was required in the
army during the war; and then it had the cases called up, and
the bonds declared forfeited. The two cases were ordered dismissed,
and, some several years afterward, the bondsmen were
finally released by the “Commissioners of Revenue” without
injury.</p>

<p>Nothing is plainer than of the prosecution being glad of
any plausible pretext for dismissing the cases—anything in the
shape of a convenient opportunity for relief in the awkward
situation in which it stood. Why so determined and successful
to bring on instanter the first case in spite of the most
powerful reasons for a temporary continuance? And why,
when this was over, was it equally determined and successful
to ward off the two remaining cases? Is it not evident, notwithstanding
all the prostituted forces at command, that it was
unwilling to make a second experiment? But how stands the
presiding Judge affected in this slimy affair? In the first case,
in defiance of the most powerful cause assigned in favor, he
would not allow one hour of continuance of the case; but from
term to term, from year to year, he allowed the prosecution all
it wanted, regardless of all the urgent efforts of the defendant
for the remaining trials to be proceeded with to save entire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
ruin from excessive and repeated expenses. But when the defendant’s
absence was compelled by demands made from the
War Department, then did this Judge allow the case to be
pressed forward by the prosecution, and the bonds declared
forfeited! If this junta, or combination of Judge with the
prosecution did not exist, the plainest of all circumstantial
demonstrations are not worthy of any notice whatever. But
this is only one instance out of a number, which will be given
of this Judge’s partiality—of his palpable efforts to do violence
to justice.</p>

<p>Again, mark his conduct in endeavoring to obtain a forced
and unnatural verdict. After twenty-four hours of close confinement,
the jury returned with the report that there was no
earthly chance of coming to an agreement. The Judge bid
them, contrary to all custom, to again retire, with a declaration
that he would hold it in confinement until the verdict
could be made up, even though an indefinite period were required
to accomplish the object.</p>

<p>Had he before been in consultation with the prosecution?
Did he know the whole arrangement? Did he know that some
one or more, perhaps influenced by gold, were resolved to hold
out to the bitter end? And that one by one of the opposition,
under the tortures of long confinement, must keep falling in to
avoid further suffering, and more especially when the cunning
device was resorted to for the purpose of deceiving the opposition
by inducements to the effect that it was hardly worth
while holding out when all could be so easily avoided by a few
dollars of fine in the way of damages, which would not at all
hurt the defendant? What was the meaning of the sham in
his appearing, in the first part of his instructions, to lean to
the defendant by telling the jury that if there was a doubt existing
with it, the defendant was entitled to the benefit of said
doubt; and then, in the last hours of worn out confinement,
came squarely out in conflict, and positively told the jury that
it was bound to find a verdict of guilty from the law and evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
before it? What was the meaning of packages and
writing being conveyed to the jury by outsiders during the
latter part of its retirement, or, at least, to that part of it in
favor of the prosecution?</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the most justifiable and potent of all reasons
in favor of the petition got up and signed by six hundred
of the best and most respectable citizens of Mobile to be forwarded
to the Governor for the release of the defendant, the
Judge hearing of the same, emphatically declared, before being
asked, that he would not sign it; and the Governor, because of
this omission, refused to grant the prayer. Did the prosecution
influence both Governor and Judge, so that the whole
formed one compact ring to defeat justice? What says the
learned Dr. Bevell on this subject—the very man who sat on
this jury and witnessed all:</p>

<p>“We have made an effort to limit his imprisonment through
the pardoning power of Governor Moore, by an article addressed
him in the shape of a petition, with about six hundred
signatures of the most respectable citizens of Mobile; but in
this we have failed, and, to my deepest regret, he will have to
serve his time out. We first drew up a petition to Judge McKinstry,
signed by a respectable number of the jury, but hearing
of his negative declarations on the street, we declined honoring
him with the request.</p>

<p>“<em>Although we have failed in these efforts, the conduct of all
the opposing clique strongly indicate to my mind that the principal
stringent ruling and opposition are to gratify, and sustain,
and retain political influence.</em>”</p>

<p>But the abuses committed by Judge McKinstry do not close
here. A verbal copy of Shoemake’s affidavit has just been received,
the insertion of which cannot be omitted, as it will add
new light on what has already been advanced on this subject
in the commencing part of the trial, and will go still further to
demonstrate the deeply sullied conduct of the prosecution and
Judge. Let this copy be read with attention:</p>

<h3>THE CHARACTER OF THE PROSECUTION.</h3>

<p>Scheumack or Shoemake, all the while a citizen of Mississippi,
the defendant a citizen of Mississippi, yet, he goes to
the City of Mobile, in another State, among his friends and
brethren, for process of law. This was changing of venue with
a vengeance. With equal propriety, as far as law is concerned,
might he not have gone to New York—not one whit more unnatural.</p>

<p>Sheumack, the “big dog” among the clan; the man, above
all others, steeped the deepest in blood, and crime, and dissimulation;
the man who brought counterfeit documents pretending
to come from the Probate Judge of Kemper county; the
man who denied writing the John R. Garland letter on the witness
stand, and whose oath was there invalidated to the satisfaction
of all; the man who bore the requisition from the
Governor of Alabama to the Governor of Mississippi for the
arrest of the defendant; this is the man to whom Judge McKinstry
granted his writ to serve the purposes as specified
in the affidavit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>This affidavit charges with “unlawfully, wickedly, and maliciously,
with intent to injury, defame, villify, and prejudice the
deponent:” and again “this deponent is represented by the
name of Shonesmak, as a member of a clan or gang of robbers,
murderers, and thieves, which statement, referring to the deponent,
is a defamatory libel, and utterly and wholly untrue.”</p>

<p>In answer, will any one deny that such a “clan” existed?
Will any one deny that its whole object was robbery, murder,
and theft? It is presumed that none will have the effrontery to
make such a denial in the face of such overwhelming testimony
almost everywhere to be found.</p>

<p>The next thing to be considered is, did the defendant publish
and circulate, with an intent to defame, villify, and prejudice,
etc., one represented by the name of Shouesmack, as
belonging to the said clan?</p>

<p>Is there one disinterested and unprejudiced being in existence
who can believe that the defendant could have any
motive for “wickedly, maliciously.” etc., assailing somebody
he before knew nothing about, either good or bad—not even
before knowing that such a creature was in existence? Up to
that time, unacquainted with a single act of his life, can any one
believe that the defendant published and circulated with a wicked
and malicious intent to defame and prejudice somebody he
neither knew by person or reputation before? Maliciousness
can not exist while unconscious of any cause for the same. So
much then for the unlawful, wicked and malicious attempt to
injure the <em>fair fame</em> of Scheumack.</p>

<p>The same arguments will apply with equal force to the other
names as published being the same as given by Copeland to the
defendant; for to suppose otherwise would be the height of
absurdity. The next subject for inquiry is, did Copeland, in
his list of names, include Scheumack rightfully or wrongfully?</p>

<p><em>Shonesmack</em>, and not Scheumack, was given in the published
list in consequence of a typographical error. But Scheumack
declared that the published name must mean him, and the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
publication was “having a very deleterious effect against him in
his own county, Kemper.” Why was Scheumack so very sensitive?
Why did he take on himself the published name of
<em>Shonesmack</em>? Why was the publication having a very deleterious
effect against him in his county, Kemper? An innocent
man by the name of <em>Scheumack</em> would hardly have troubled
himself much about Shonesmak. A man living honestly,
honorably, and respectfully in his own county would not have
taken any umbrage at all from the publication. Around here, there
are quite a number by the same, or very similar, name, yet none
of these complained against the publication having a very deleterious
effect against them. Those who foam, and rave, and
curse the hardest, are generally the object on whom suspicion
falls the heaviest.</p>

<p>But this is not all, immediately after the publication of the
pamphlet complained of, he wrote his John R. Garland letter,
in which he described himself with the most perfect of accuracy
as being occasionally absent for some time, and then returning
with horses and mules, and other sorts of property which nobody
besides himself could account for, etc. Let it be borne
in mind that he denied writing this letter on oath on the witness
stand, when the conclusive proof came next that he undoubtedly
was the author of it. The counterfeit papers, with
feigned authority from the Probate Judge of Kemper county,
his several designs on the life of the defendant, with many
other of his actions which are more than suspicious, all go to
establish the fact that Copeland made no mistake when he gave
his name and designated him as a “big dog” among the clan.</p>

<p>Ye, Governors, Judges and prosecutors, learn from the old
adage: “Tell me the company you keep, and I will tell you who
you are.”</p>

<p>But there is something left behind of a still darker and more
enigmatical character as to the mockery in processes of law
belonging to the case.</p>

<p>Scheumack, a resident of another State, goes to Mobile to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
prosecute for libel, and Judge McKinstry grants him the writ
accordingly. The Sheriff is represented as returning the same
to the effect that the writ had been executed, and the defendant
in jail on the 17th of January, 1859. Again, the trial docket
and the records show that four bills were got against the defendant
from the Grand Jury the November term, 1858, marked
cases numbers 61, 62, 63, 64, corresponding to which are given
the names of G. Y. Overall, C. F. Moulton, G. A. Cleaveland,
and S. S. Scheumack; and that the name of Scheumack disappeared
subsequently without any order being made or without
any cause being assigned for the same; and furthermore four
appearance bonds given by the defendant are found on file in
the office. In these cases, there is no record of any action being
taken by either Governor of Alabama or Mississippi, the
reason for which, perhaps, may be accounted for by the innovation
and wrong being too great for Governors’ names to be
associated with on record.</p>

<p>Now, it is evident, from the affidavit of Scheumack, that he
did not get a bill at the time the other three did from the
Grand Jury of 1858, and it is equally evident that he never
afterward got one; then why was his case associated on the
trial docket with the other three?</p>

<p>The writ executed and returned asserts the defendant to be
in jail on the 17th of January, 1859. What a farce! If the
defendant was in jail at that time, it so mysteriously happened
that he never knew it. A bond is found on file in the office
given by the defendant to answer the charge preferred by
Scheumak. What a farce! If the defendant gave such a bond,
he never knew it—was never called on to sign it—never went
before any examining magistrate, nor never knew, until a few
days ago, that Scheumack had ever succeeded in any action of
law against him.</p>

<p>Ye prosecutors, answer, if you can, how the records are
made to show that Scheumack got a bill from the Grand Jury
of the November term, 1858, when his affidavit of January 17,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
1859, shows conclusively that he never got any such bill at all.
Answer, if you can, how his name so mysteriously disappeared
from the trial docket without any order being made, or without
any cause being assigned for the same. Answer, if you can,
how the appearance bond relative to him and the defendant is
found on file in the office, when no such bond could possibly
have been given. Answer, if you can, how the defendant came
to be in jail on the 17th of January, 1859, when thousands positively
know that such was not the case. If “something rotten
in Denmark” is not found here, it is vain to seek from any
other quarter.</p>


<h3 id="CONCLUDING_SKETCH_OF_THE_TRIAL">CONCLUDING SKETCH OF THE TRIAL.</h3>

<p>Not in populous cities—not in the centres of accumulated
wealth and misdirected intelligence that integrity and the administration
of justice can be found. The highest functionaries
of States have to bend to these rings and cliques. Honor
scorned, justice mocked, and shame departed, what is there left
to purify the national streams? Clans who live by plunder
and murder can, with their ill-gotten gains, find plenty of law
protection. Above all things, the Bench should be kept pure
and independent, so that the criminal, though rich, cannot
escape; and the poor and humble, if honest, can receive
protection. Not as now, when judicial decisions are measured
according to political numbers and the varied influences of
wealth. If mercy is shown at all, let it be on the side of the
unfortunate and those who have had few opportunities for improvement;
and never on the side of those who have had all
the advantages of wealth and education, and who should set
an example to the subordinate classes of the community. Let
the lessons cease to be taught and children cease to learn that
because a man is rich no crime can hurt him; and if poor,
though honest, he can be victimized by a snap of the finger
from some influential person at any time. Is it any wonder at
the increasing centralization of power? It is a necessary consequence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
under present circumstances. The corruptions and
abominations have nearly reached the maximum height, and
are at present of such a frightful magnitude that some remedy,
ere long, must be adopted. Liberty abused must bring on reaction,
sometimes for the better, but oftener for evils as great
as those desired to be remedied.</p>

<p>And now, in concluding this sketch of the trial, which was
carried on with so much absorbing interest and excitement, a
brief recapitulation of its paramount features may be of some
utility in bringing within our immediate view those incidents
of it which are the most pregnant of meaning as to the future
consequences.</p>

<p>In reviewing the conduct of the then Governor of Mississippi,
McWillie, it is not charity, nor warranted by correct
inductive reasoning, to suppose that he intended to assist the
Wages and Copeland Clan by giving his approval for the rendition
of the defendant as a “fugitive from justice,” at the time
he was an acting Sheriff for one of the counties of the State.
It is, perhaps, better to suspect the Governor’s ignorance or
want of the proper information, than to charge him with evil
designs. Had he known at the time the desperate character of
Shoemake, one of the clan, and the authorized agent to make
the arrest; had he known that the defendant knew nothing of
the names prior to the confessions, and, of course, could have
had no interest nor malicious motive to misrepresent, with the
fact of locating the Three Distinguished at the risk of protracted
trouble and a ruinous expense, furnishing a strong inference
of the truth of all as to the names inserted; had he
known that Copeland himself, on the scaffold in the last
moments of earthly existence, acknowledged publicly and before
living witnesses the truth of the whole of his confessions;
had he known and reflected that the full publication of them
must have, not only a direct and powerful tendency to disorganize
the remnant of the clan, but also to prevent future associations
of a similar character; had he known the full extent of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
the horrors, for years, perpetrated by this clan, and that numbers
still living, from experience, can vouch for many of the
facts as narrated in the confessions; had he known that an
offense committed in one State or county, and the injury sustained
inflicted in another State or county, the case may be
tried in either, which gave him the right to use his discretion;
had he known and reflected that the conflict must be between
prosecutors—revengeful and experienced, wealthy and powerful,
from another State, against youth—against an humble but
honest citizen of his own State; had he known all these circumstances
and maturely considered them, censure could not
be too severely applied for his approving the rendition of the
defendant as “a fugitive from justice.” Who ever before heard
of any person being dragged from one State to another as a
malefactor on a charge of <em>libel</em>?</p>

<p>However, if he, without design, gave assistance to the clan
in the shape of an unmerited expense and injury to the defendant,
it is nevertheless true that he also, without design, was
instrumental in laying the foundation for a more distant
triumph in behalf of justice.</p>

<p>Many of the last observations are strictly applicable to the
presiding Judge, McKinstry. We cannot believe that he had
any affiliation with the clan, nor any sympathy for its continuance;
but his reprehensible conduct on the trial can be better
accounted for in the language of the competent gentleman who
sat on the jury, and who had an opportunity of seeing and
hearing and witnessing all, thus: “His strenuous ruling,
strongly indicated to my mind, was to retain and maintain
political influence with powerful cliques.”</p>

<p>The changing of this Judge’s charges, the veering about first
from one side to the other, his expressed determination to
force a verdict against the better informed and more respectable
of those who formed a great majority of the jury, if it required
an indefinite period of confinement to do it; and then, in
the last hours of torture, came squarely out and told the jury<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
it was bound, from the law and evidence before it, to find a
verdict of guilty; and all this while knowing the awful character
of Shoemake, one of the main witnesses, as proven on
the trial; and while knowing that G. Y. Overall had no right
to prosecute in the name of G. Overall, when there were more
of the same name in the place, and to which the jury believed
the confessions applied as intended by Copeland; and more,
after conviction, anticipating something righteously in favor
of the defendant, this partial Judge declared his intention before
hand not to sign any petition for the release of the defendant
from the prison; all these incidents taken together are too
strongly stamped to be explained away. The refusal of the
defendant’s application against the strongest of reasons in
contrast with his unreasonable granting the prosecution all it
wanted for several years afterwards, is also something which
will not soon be forgotten.</p>

<p>But it may be said that Judge McKinstry did no more than
is fashionable in the present day—that of consulting political
interest in preference to the eternal laws of justice. This is
but too true. It is a deplorable fact that, from the most inferior
to the highest of courts and officers, measures are gauged
according to political considerations and wealthy favorites.
Truth is sometimes very disagreeable, but it is nevertheless
indisputable that when the progress is rapidly onward to idolize
vast possessions under a system which rather favors than
checks the spread of those evils which sap the very foundations
of strength and national vitality, and at the same time, and in
the same ratio, to dishonor the real sources of wealth—honest
labor—the nation’s decline and fall will follow in the wake of
consequences under excessive government, no matter whether
of Republican or Democratic. The baneful effects from either
will be pretty much the same, as long as there are lacking the
<em>will</em> and the <em>power</em> to restrain or repress excesses as they
spring up. When general means of subsistence are easy, with
plenty everywhere abounding, there is not much danger of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
convulsive change; but a prodigious increase of population with
proportionally narrower resources to command, together with
extensive disaffection and oppressive burdens from previous
wars, then is the time for the exercise of prudence and a strict
administration of justice in every department to maintain the
life of the nation.</p>

<p>Granted that G. Y. Overall proved satisfactorily enough an
alibi, that is, that he was not present at the time referred to;
but it is again asked what was he doing associated with such
men as Shoemake and Bentonville Taylor? Was he the tool of
more designing men? What right—what necessity had he to
turn prosecutor, when, as plainly elicited on trial, it was another
Overall that Copeland referred to in his confessions?</p>

<p>The trial succeeded in nothing against the defendant only in
crippling his pecuniary resources, and harrassing him in other
ways. It rather strengthened than weakened the authenticity
of the work. These circumstances, with the war, interrupted
the sale for some years; but as might have been reasonably expected,
truth can only be temporarily crushed to burst forth
again with renewed vigor. Persecution only adds fuel to the
flames.</p>

<p>Sick of the career of life which he had led, it was but natural
for Copeland to repine against those who had shared his
plunder and goaded him on to crime with ample promises of
protection, and then deserted him in the last hours of his
affliction.</p>

<p>The defendant could have had no conceivable motive to forge
names—not knowing before Copeland gave them, that such
persons were in existence; therefore, where there is no possible
motive, there can be no crime or intentional wrong. So much
then for the “wicked and malicious intentions,” as charged in
the affidavit of Shoemake.</p>

<p>The foregoing observations close the narrations of the trial
with the circumstances of connection belonging; and now for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
particulars, as reasonably presumed, of another attempt on the
life of the defendant in 1862.</p>

<p>Throughout the proceedings of the trial Dr. Pitts has been
properly referred to as the “defendant.” Hereafter his own
proper name will be given.</p>


<h3 id="ANOTHER_DESIGN_OF_ASSASSINATION">ANOTHER DESIGN OF ASSASSINATION.</h3>

<p>In the spring of 1862, when returning from a professional
visit, he was waylaid by two persons to him entire strangers.
Just before the Doctor reached a by-path he was accustomed
to travel, because somewhat nearer, he first suddenly discovered
one of them near the main road, in a bunch of bushes
by a stump, some fifty or seventy-five yards distant. The Doctor
made a quick change of position; the rays of the sun fell
on the bright gun in possession, which reflected a dazzling
brilliancy for the moment. This extraordinary circumstance
of itself was sufficient to cause well-grounded apprehensions of
danger; and, accordingly, the Doctor kept a close watch for an
excited moment. No sooner had he taken the by-path above
alluded to, than he saw one of the two rush out—fast running
through the thick woods in order to intercept him. The Doctor
instantly turning his course, he at once beheld another
person running in the same direction. There was but one
available outlet for the Doctor to make his escape, and this
through a long narrow valley with obstructing hills on each
side. Both made a strenuous effort to get ahead of him in the
valley, but fortunately he was mounted on a fine animal very
fast on speed, which successfully enabled him to escape
unhurt.</p>

<p>As before stated, these two parties were entire strangers, and
never spoke a word during the whole transaction. On peaceable
terms with every one in the settlement around, so far as
known, there could not be a doubt on his mind as to this movement
being another attempt on his life from the clan for the sake
of vengeance for the past, and to prevent republication in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
the future. The same conclusions must be arrived at by every
impartial judge of the affair.</p>

<p>The following tragic accounts have recently been carefully
collected from authentic and reliable sources, which, here introduced,
will form something like an episode of after transactions
of the parties whose names are also found in Copeland’s confessions—transactions
exactly of a character to correspond
with the dark and bloody operations as given by Copeland
himself.</p>


<h3 id="SHOEMAKE_AGAIN">SHOEMAKE AGAIN.</h3>

<p>From whatever stand-point viewed, there is something extraordinary
about this man. He was particularly distinguished
in the art of sculpture. He built the jail in DeKalb, Kemper
county, Miss., which, when completed, was pronounced a
master-piece of workmanship for substantial security. But in
some length of time afterward, the report got out, probably
from his own boasting, or some unguarded expression which
he had made use of, that it was not safe. Inspection of the
minutest sort followed, but not a sign of insecurity was discovered.
However, when he got ready, he volunteered to show,
and did show the defect which all previous search had utterly
failed to find. He pointed to a place in the wall so perfectly
concealed, yet with a very little exertion a vent could be made
quite large enough for one person to pass out.</p>

<p>He was expert and dexterous in everything he engaged, but,
as time developed, with an ultimate object of fraudulent gain in
one way or the other. He was a scholar, yet this capacity only
enabled him to attain greater heights of rascality with less liability
of detection. Politeness, civility, and the most consummate
of gentlemanly airs he could assume when his nefarious
purposes could be best served by so doing. He was cruel, but
not brave. It is said that the sister of his now brother-in-law
received cruel treatment from him in youth; and for years this
brother-in law determinedly bore it in mind, and at maturity
beat Shoemake unmercifully for the same. This is a case with
one man that Shoemake childishly dreaded ever afterward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>But his wife, formally called Muggy Worbington, was made
of different material. She was brave sure enough, which was
sufficiently evidenced on a number of occasions; one of which
was in making two men, who had before vehemently offended
her, jump precipitately into the river from a flat to avoid the
contents of a revolver which was too resolutely presented to be
mistaken.</p>

<p>And again, in the malignant feud between the Shoemake and
Fisher family, which culminated in a pitched battle with shot-guns
and pistols, near a brickyard, half a mile north of old
Marion, Lauderdale county, Miss., in the fall of 1844, or early
in 1845. Shoemake and his wife against Fisher and two sons,
William and Theophilous. The fire from the Fisher family
was too hot and severe for Shoemake; he left in haste and deserted
his wife, who fought inch by inch with unfaltering fortitude
until shot down by the greater opposing force with which
she was in conflict.</p>

<p>Shoemake, before leaving Kemper county, made intimations
as if disposed to divulge the interesting historical part of his
life; and, at the same time, in reference to the tremendous disaster
he sustained on the trial of Dr. Pitts; made significant
remarks of a double meaning, but really of a nature to warrant
the impression that the publisher of the Life and Career of
Copeland would pass off this stage of existence, which would
be certain to leave mystery behind for future contemplation.</p>

<p>Shoemake resided in and around Kemper county for a number
of years. His conduct was always suspicious, but his address,
his ingenuity, and his whole movements were so profoundly
managed as to evade penal detection. Years had to
elapse to fully develop the man for anything like a common
consent as to his real Character. It but required time to
satisfy the judgment of all that he tainted everything he
touched. And this is the man who was so sensitive because
Copeland confessed him to be “a big dog among the clan.”</p>

<h3 id="THE_TWO_HARDENS_AND_THE_MURDER_OF_SHERIFF_SMITH">THE TWO HARDENS AND THE MURDER OF SHERIFF SMITH.</h3>

<p>The names of the two Hardens were given by Copeland as
forming a part of the clan. More about them has since been
collected, which will now be read with interest.</p>

<p>About the year 1853 John Harden, from the State of Alabama,
stole a fine animal, buggy and negro man, and succeeded
in getting them safely to Marion county, Miss., where his
mother resided. The Sheriff, Mr. Smith, from the county in
Alabama where said property was stolen from, pursued Harden,
and on reaching this State, Mississippi, he employed the services
of Philip James, of Greene county, to accompany him.
Finding Harden in the night at his mother’s, he was by them
taken on surprise, but made a desperate resistance, though
being overpowered, was compelled to surrender. The horse,
buggy and negro man were all found. Sheriff Smith had Harden
confined within the buggy, and the negro man ordered to
ride the horse. On returning, and when they reached the residence
of Philip James, Sheriff Smith made no further request
on Mr. James, and thought he could then manage without any
further assistance. Accordingly they started, but shortly after
they had crossed Chickasahay river the Sheriff was killed—appearances
indicating that he had been beaten to death by a
club. But whether by Harden or the negro man, none ever
were able to ascertain. The buggy was rolled off under a hill.
The horses and the two persons made their escape for the time
being. Nothing positively definite, but the report followed
that in some six or eight months afterward Harden was apprehended
by Smith’s friends, and by lynch operations finished his
career by being hung to the limb of a tree.</p>

<p>His brother, also mentioned by Copeland, who married a
daughter of Gideon Rustin, was hung in Columbia, Mississippi,
about the year 1843, for the murder of his wife. Immediately
after the murder, he made his escape, and got into the State of
Georgia, where he remained for some months; but subsequently
returned and gave himself up to the sheriff, but had not been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
long in prison till he broke out, and would probably made his
escape, but was captured by some parties in a boat near by
while he was in the act of swimming Pearl river.</p>

<p>John Harden was a powerful man, not only in physical
strength, but also in determined energies and resolution. Years
ago, it is said that he and Hampton H. Nichols, of Perry county
Mississippi, disagreed—followed by a fight betwixt the two in
the usual manner, and that Harden came out the best; although,
for nerve and surpassing strength, it was before thought that
Nichols had not a superior. Thus, one by one do the members
of the “clan” drop into eternity by violent and unnatural terminations.</p>


<h3 id="JAMES_MARTHUR_OR_CALICO_DICK">JAMES M’ARTHUR, OR “CALICO DICK.”</h3>

<p>There are others of the “clan” still active and surviving.
James McArthur—better known in some places by the appellation
of “Calico Dick” still lives. By reference to the
original history of the Wages and Copeland clan, <a href="#Page_89">page 89</a>, it
will be seen that this man became connected with the organization
in 1844; and, at the time, was acknowledged by the
former members as being directly concerned with others engaged
in the business of counterfeiting money. Dr. Pitts has
taken considerable trouble in tracing out the character of this
man, and has received information from the best citizens of
Mississippi and Alabama. Let this information be read with
care and attention; and then, who can have the effrontery to
contend that the names given in the “confessions” “are forged
and the entire work unworthy of credit.”</p>

<p>In former years, when the Wages and Copeland organization
was in full blast, he was then looked on as a suspicious character
and believed to belong to the clan, as well as having more
or less to do with the counterfeiting business which had been
the means of flooding the country with a spurious circulation.</p>

<p>This organized band of robbers, murderers and counterfeiters
had become such a terror to the seashore counties of Mississippi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
that the good people of these sections were driven to the
necessity of forming a “Vigilance Committee,” for the better
protection and preservation of society. By this committee,
many suspicious persons were arrested, among whom was Jim
McArthur. He, with a rope around his neck, piloted the committee
to the swamp, where he pointed out and dug up the
coining apparatus which was used by the band in coining
counterfeit money. Here he acknowledged his identity with
the counterfeiters, and was only released on his solemn vow to
leave the country—never more to show his face in that region
of society. Accordingly, he did leave, and was not seen there
again until during the late war between the States, when he
returned and was a great source of trouble again to all the
neighboring counties around—committing more crimes of a
more shocking and atrocious character.</p>

<p>After the close of the war, he again left that vicinity, and
made his headquarters in Mobile, Alabama, where occasionally
he was seen very flush of money. Also, after the war, he made
a visit to Perry county, Mississippi. While there, he made
inquiry after a woman, who had left her husband while the
national contest was going on. The supposition is that he,
made her acquaintance on Honey Island during the war.</p>

<p>He is now well known to all this country as a renowned
traveling gambler; and, among the fraternity of that class, is
probably better known by the name of “Calico Dick,” which
appellation he received many years ago, according to his own
statement, when but a youth, in the State of Georgia, for stealing
a bolt of calico, and for the same received thirty-nine
lashes. But particulars on this subject will be best understood
by giving an extract of a letter from one of Mississippi’s
gifted sons:</p>

<p>“Calico Dick is the same brigand—the infamous Jim McArthur.
He himself states that when he was a youth in Georgia,
he stole a bolt of calico—was detected and received thirty-nine
lashes, and ever since has been called Calico Dick. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
was suspected of murdering a peddlar in Hancock county years
ago, and acknowledged, with the rope around his neck, to the
vigilant committee that he was a counterfeiter, and pointed out
the apparatus for coining—confessed to horse-stealing and
negro-stealing, and had left his wife and children in Hancock
county to starve or do worse. His nephew, young Frost, who
kept a cigar stand in or near the Battle House, Mobile, was
arrested at Bay St. Louis last year on the charge of murder, and
carried to Alabama. I have not heard the result. McArthur
was unquestionably one of the Copeland clan. He committed
many crimes during the war. At any time during the second
year of the war, when we had no law, if I had met him, I would
have shot him from my knowledge of his crimes.”</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Jackson County</span>, 1873.<br>
</p>

<p>From another friend, in Jackson county, he still further
exhibits the man in his true colors:</p>

<p>“James McArthur, long known as Calico Dick, has resided
many years in Hancock county, Mississippi. Though absent
frequently for months, sometimes for a year or two. His own
statement when he first appeared in the county, was, that he stole
a piece of calico, from a country store in Georgia, and being
detected received thirty-nine lashes. So far from being
ashamed of this exploit, he boasts of it, and when drinking
often repeats the story of his filthy life. He soon made himself
known in Hancock as a gambler; and from his frequent
mysterious journeys, and generally returning with a fine horse
and plenty of money, he became an object of general suspicion.
The Murrell clan, and, subsequently, the Wages and Copeland
clan were then operating throughout the country. Negro-stealing,
horse-stealing, counterfeiting, highway robbery and
murder had been reduced to a system, and it was rare that anybody
was brought to justice. If any party was arrested, some
of the clan was always on hand to prove an <em>alibi</em>. Suspicion
very often pointed to an individual, but people were afraid to
hint their suspicions lest they might draw down upon them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
some secret vengeance—the burning of their dwellings or assassination.
Thus, crime was committed with impunity. A
peddler, known to have considerable money, was found murdered
in Hancock, and though there was but one opinion as to who
committed the deed, no one was arrested. The county was
flooded with spurious coin. McArthur was known to make
frequent journeys towards Mobile and to the Sabine on the
Texas line, and when he returned, there was always an influx of
bad money in circulation. He generally brought one or more
strangers. Men of doubtful character, and with no apparent
means of living, and never known to work, began to multiply,
and this class was constantly around McArthur, and looked up
to him as their chief. Though known to be personally an
abject coward, he became, through these desperate men, an
object of terror to the timid; and even respectable men were
weak enough to court his favor. The late Col. D. C. Glenn would
often say, after his attendance on the Hancock Circuit Courts,
that he was shocked to see decent men jesting and drinking
with such a wretch! The secret was that these men dreaded
him and his gang.</p>

<p>Finally, somewhere about 1845, counterfeiting, horse-stealing,
stock-stealing, and other crimes became so common; and
the county so swarmed with idle, worthless, and suspicious
characters, the citizens of Hancock formed a vigilance committee
for mutual protection. It embraced the best, most responsible,
and determined men in the county. They arrested a
number of persons, most of whom confessed to being, or having
been, members of the Murrell and Wages clans. The
names of these men, and what became of them, can be given to
you by some old citizen—such as Col. Claiborne, S. T. Randall,
Luther Russ, J. W. Roberts, and others. Those who confessed
to belonging to the above named clans, were to a man the boon
companions and associates of the notorious Jim McArthur, alias
Calico Dick. The committee finally arrested him. I have
been told that nearly the entire committee was for hanging him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
instanter. Indeed the rope was around his neck; but some
one suggested that if they hung him, many important secrets
would die with him; and that it was better to spare his life on
the conditions of full confession and his immediate and perpetual
departure from the county and State. The cowardly
and treacherous scoundrel clutched at this expedient to save
his life. He acknowledged his crimes, gave the names of his
associates, and piloted the committee to his camp in the Devil’s
swamp, where he fabricated spurious money. The moulds,
forge, and a quantity of base metal were found there. The
forger should have been handed over to the U. S. authorities,
but he was permitted to leave the county on his oath (what
was the oath of such a creature worth,) never to return. He
left immediately for Alabama, where it would be worth while
to track him. When the war broke out, and the vigilance
committee of Hancock no longer existed—its most prominent
members having died or removed—this self-confessed felon returned
to the county. He appeared there, I am told, in the
character of a bounty jumper or substitute broker, in which
he swindled a number of confiding people. A band of his old
associates returned about the same time, and during the war
became the terror and scourge of the country. Some were deserters
from the Confederate ranks—some joined the United
State army, and deserted their colors came back to their old
haunts and their old leader. Some were professional
thieves, robbers, and murderers, who never belonged to
either army, but took to bushwacking, and jayhawking for a
living; robbed the old, the widow, and the orphan without
scruple, and often added arson and murder to their robberies.
McArthur was constantly on the wing on the old pattern followed
by Wages and Copeland. Since the war, he has passed
much of his time in Alabama; but I am informed by citizens
of Hancock that he has for some months past been dwelling in
that county. His doings in Alabama ought to be traced out.
What he is after in his obscure den in Hancock county, will, no
doubt, in due time, crop out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>Calico Dick is described by those who have seen him as
having the appearance of being deformed from the effect of
disease. The external appearance indicate considerable curvature
of the spine. Others more intimate and better acquainted
with him, say that this seeming curvature is caused by the constant
wearing of a steel plate, which is used for the purpose of
carrying cards; and that the plate is so constructed that he
can without detection take from or add to his hand while playing,
and with the assistance of his spring plate renders it impossible
for any one to compete with him in this department
of gambling.</p>

<p>The report of his death by being shot near St. Stevens is
proven to be false. There is now a letter in the possession of
John Champenoies, a resident of Shubuta, Clarke county, Mississippi,
from Calico Dick, dated at Pensacola Junction, the
28th of May, 1873, and mailed at Whiting, Alabama.</p>

<p>There is another incident in his life which is rather amusing,
and should not be entirely overlooked. In the year of 1868,
he purchased a ticket to Enterprise, on M. &amp; O. R. R., to Quitman,
and got on board of a freight train, which carried him to
the next station below, DeSoto, some four or five miles further
than he wanted to go, and he had to walk back again. For this
he sued the company, and got judgment against it to the tune
of several thousand dollars; but the case was carried to High
Court, and judgment reversed for a new trial. However, a
compromise was made, and the company only paid him five
hundred dollars, and gave him a free ticket on the road to ride
afterwards.</p>

<p>Since writing the above, Dr. Pitts entertained some doubts
of the truths of the whole of this story; and, to be better satisfied
on the matter, wrote to one member of the company in
high position, and received from him by way of reply the
following:</p>

<p>“I know James McArthur, often called ‘Calico Dick,’ but
know little of his antecedents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>“He did bring a suit against the railroad for taking him past
Quitman to DeSoto, I think in 1867 or 1868, and Judge Leachman
gave judgment on demurrer, <em>not a jury</em>, for, I think,
$10,000. Exceptions were taken, and the case sent to the
High Court, where the error was cause to send it back for a
new trial. Before the new trial was had he proposed to compromise,
and I did so for $500, he paying costs, but I do not
know that he did pay, as he said he had given security for
costs, and the Clerk might make them.</p>

<p>“I have not seen ‘Calico’ in the last two years, but presume
he lives, and has his ‘Tiger’ yet. The last time I saw him
was at State Line, where he told me he was ‘flat broke,’ and
his ‘Tiger’ in ‘soak,’ and he wanted with his whole soul a
ticket to Mobile on credit. He got it, and I have not seen him
since.</p>

<p>“June 25, 1874.”</p>

<p>There must be something remarkable about this man, otherwise
he could not so long have escaped the last penalties of the
law and the vengeance of an outraged population. The last
heard of him, of import, was his visit to Escatawpa, Ala., a
short time before the foul murder of W. C. Stanley, of this
place, particulars of which the reader will now examine, as related
to Dr. Pitts by one of the main witnesses involved in the
case; but it should be first remembered that “Calico Dick”
made a visit to Escatawpa, then left for Mobile, Ala., and in a
few days after his nephew, Frost, came to Escatawpa. The
current belief is that he was induced to do so under the influence
of his uncle.</p>


<h3 id="REFLECTIONS_ON_THE_FOREGOING">REFLECTIONS ON THE FOREGOING, AND ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF
INABILITY TO REPRESS SUCH FLAGRANT AND WELL KNOWN
CRIMES.</h3>

<p>The masterly description of the terrible clans as they have
heretofore existed, and as given by the natural as well as artistical
pen of the Jackson county correspondent, cannot be overestimated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
It will well pay for perusal and re-perusal again
and again. Let the following quotations never be forgotten:</p>

<p>“The worst of human crimes had been reduced to a system,
and it was rare that anybody was brought to justice. If any
party was arrested some of the clan was always on hand to
prove an alibi. Suspicions often pointed to an individual, but
people were afraid to hint their suspicions lest they might draw
down upon them some secret vengeance—the burning of their
dwellings or assassination. Thus crime was committed with
impunity. A peddler, known to have considerable money, was
found murdered in Hancock, and though there was but one
opinion as to who committed the deed, no one was arrested.
McArthur, though personally known to be an abject coward,
became, through desperate men which he commanded, an object
of terror to the timid; and even respectable men were weak
enough to court his favor. The late Colonel Glenn would
often say, after his attendance on the Hancock Circuit Courts,
that he was shocked to see decent men jesting and drinking
with such a wretch! The secret was that these men dreaded
him and his gang.”</p>

<p>The above is a whole volume for contemplation. Decent,
respectable, and distinguished persons jesting and drinking
with renowned and scientific criminals through fear of conflagration
and assassination. No efforts made to bring to justice—crime
passing with respectable impunity.</p>

<p>Honor crime, and numbers will soon increase prodigiously.
Make escape easy and almost certain, and the law will carry
no terrors with it. Grievances, real or imaginary, and opportunities
will be sought to bring in play the bowie-knife and
revolver. Let life’s warm stream flow freely, the sight common,
and human life will soon be worth no more than the dog’s.
Let a callous indifference pervade the community when the
tidings of outrage, robbery and murder are brought, and soon
will the great arteries of a State’s wealth and prosperity begin
to languish and decay. Under such a system, can civilization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
progress? Will capital invest to set the springs of industry at
work? Can wealth and intelligence thrive under such blighting
influences of desolation? Is not government strong enough
to protect its subjects? If not it should be, and the sooner it
can be accomplished, the better it will be for all classes of society.
Even affluent railroad companies have to bend to such
men as Jim McArthur. To produce wide-spread fear and
social insecurity, it is not necessary for crime and murder to
be of an every-day occurrence; it is the hopelessness of getting
redress from the courts as they are at present constituted that
is so pernicious in consequences.</p>


<h3 id="THE_HORRID_MURDER_OF_W_C_STANLEY_AT_ESCATAWPA">THE HORRID MURDER OF W. C. STANLEY AT ESCATAWPA.</h3>

<p>W. C. Stanley came to Escatawpa with a small capital, and
invested to the amount of two or three hundred dollars worth
of goods. On or about the night of the 6th of June, 1872, he
was brutally murdered, and was not found until one or two days
afterward, when the woods hogs were discovered eating up his
lifeless body. An inquest was immediately held, and one on
the jury by the name of Oye, tried to implicate a colored man,
William Powe, on a plea of his having made some threats previously,
but this insignificant plea was quickly ruled out of
consideration as unworthy of any credit whatever, and properly
so, for the colored man satisfactory proved himself clear immediately
afterward. A verdict of murder by some unknown
hands was returned. However, one by the name of Frost began
to get very uneasy, and left the place the second or third day
succeeding. The passions of the citizens around became greatly
inflamed by having such a horrid murder committed within
their midst. And this was not the only one; no less than ten
other brutal murders had occurred in and about the place
within a very limited period of time. Blood and terror reigned
to an extent never before experienced. To such a pitch of
atrocity had this neighborhood got that no man could reasonably
feel safe twenty-four hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>Almost under any plea life was taken with but little hesitation
by lawless violence. However, these good citizens held
meetings to protect themselves against such diabolical outrages
which then, of late, had been perpetrated in large
numbers. They, well knowing Mr. B. F. Woulard to be a close
observer, and active and energetic in every other respect, appointed
him as the most suitable and reliable person in the
capacity of detective to ferret out and apprehend the guilty
parties. He obeyed the call, and, after Frost, took the first
train to Mobile, Alabama, where, after much trouble, he learned
that Frost had departed for Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. Still
forward, and without delay, he very soon reached that place,
where he found him stopping with one of his aunts, and
arrested him almost without disturbing the family. There
taken before the City Marshal, who was acquainted with Frost,
and knew him to be of very bad character—knew that he had
sometime before endeavored to induce young men of that city
to engage in the counterfeiting business. Mr. Woulard well
knew that Frost, prior to the murder of Stanley, was without
money, and did not really have respectable clothing to wear,
though, when arrested, he had two valises well packed with
good, substantial clothing, which he had purchased when passing
through Mobile, as learned by detective Woulard on his
return to this city, with Frost still under arrest. Then and
there, the firm of Jacobins &amp; Brisk gave information to the
effect that Frost had purchased from seventy to eighty dollars
worth from this firm. It was now plain to detective Woulard
that Frost had received money some where, and was required
to give an account of the same. He answered by declaring to
have obtained it by registered letter. On further investigation,
it was satisfactorily shown that he had received no registered
letter; and now finding it was vain to attempt to conceal
any further, he was about to make a confession of the whole
affair; but a person by the name of Cotton, in Mobile, stepped
up and learned the cause of arrest, when, to detective Woulard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
he proposed for Frost to be turned over to him for a while,
during which time he would be apt to get from him a full confession
of all the facts connected with the case. Accordingly,
Frost was placed in Cotton’s custody for something like an
hour, when he returned with this report: “You have certainly
got the right man; go now and arrest Oye and his wife, at
Escatawpa.” In compliance with such advice, detective Woulard
lost no time, but hurried back with Frost, and there did
arrest Oye.</p>

<p>But here Frost’s confession should be given, which in substance,
was as follows:</p>

<p>“At the time Stanley was absent from home on business,
Oye availed himself of the opportunity by going to Mrs.
Stanley, and by an attempt at strong reasoning, he persuaded
her to leave him—all the while believing that Stanley, in such
an event, would become so dissatisfied to an extent sufficient
to cause him to sell his goods, which could be so managed as
to give Oye the preference of purchase, when the money paid
for same could be got back by a devised scheme of robbery.
But in the interval between the commencement of the plan and
Stanley’s return, two Irish shoe-peddlers came into the neighborhood.
Oye purchased the remnant of goods they had on
hand. Forthwith one left—the other remained and boarded
with Oye. Now, Stanley returned home, and found that his
wife had left him, and his store, with all other of his effects,
in the hands of Oye. This unexpected conduct of his wife
had, according to Oye’s calculations, the desired effect. Frustrated
and discontented to an extent better imagined than
described, he at once desired to dispose of his whole interest
in the place. This was what Oye wanted, and quickly proposed
to buy him out, which proposition, under the circumstances,
was readily accepted. Oye paid the full value of the
goods without any scruples whatever, and put Frost in charge
of the same. Stanley, during the time he intended to remain
in the neighborhood, and Frost now became room mates, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
boarded at the house of Oye. Up to this time, the progress
had been attended with very little trouble, and everything
seemed to promise continued success. The next movement
was a secret consultation among the three—Oye, Frost and the
Irish shoe-peddler, the latter of which, from inference, seemed
to have before affiliated with such company, and likely his appearance
as an Irish shoe-peddler at the time had all been previously
arranged to produce the desired effect. This consultation
was for the purpose of decoying Stanley out on a fishing
excursion, so that he could be ambushed, robbed and murdered.
Frost was the person agreed on to perform the part of betraying
Stanley out, but, on more mature consideration, Oye could
not repose sufficient confidence in the Irishman—entirely ruling
him out, and broke up the first agreement. The next one
adopted was for Frost to inform Stanley that Mrs. Oye had
been receiving letters from his wife, Mrs. Stanley. Frost
further intimated that he could so manage as to get hold of
one or more of these letters, and would, the first opportunity,
do so for Stanley’s satisfaction. Stanley, very much wanting
to know the whereabouts of his wife and children, urged Frost
to get possession, if possible, of the letters the first convenient
opportunity. So far, there was a mutual understanding
between the two. But little time elapsed before Frost made
known that sure enough he had succeeded in getting the letters
from Mrs. Oye, and was then in possession of the same. Night
being present, it was agreed for Stanley to retire with him, for
the purpose of reading the letters, to a place some two hundred
yards in the rear of Oye’s drinking saloon, which place is a
pine thicket or grove. Matches were procured, and forward
they went to this designated place. Here Frost handed Stanley
some sort of a paper package; and while Stanley was in the
act of making a light from a match to a candle, Oye suddenly
rushed up with a loaded revolver, and shot Stanley through
the head—followed by five more discharges at him. After he
had fallen, Oye was about to put his hand in Stanley’s pocket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
for money, when a hollow groan was heard, indicating that the
last sign of life had not departed, to fully effect which, Oye,
with his pocket knife stabbed the victim several times in the
breast, and then cut the throat from ear to ear. Oye now
leaves Frost to get the money and drag off the corpse to some
old well near by, while Oye would return and see that all was
right outside. In this operation of dragging to the well,
Frost became alarmed and left the spot.</p>

<p>The following day, Oye made a proposition to Frost to take
an axe and cut the lifeless body to pieces, so that the same
could be sacked and thrown into Dog River. Frost declined to
do this from suspicion of a great probability of detection in so
doing. As yet, no disposition having been made of the remains,
a young man by the name of William Cooper, the
next evening, found the decomposing body with active and consuming
hogs around it. On the bloody grounds of the murder
a pistol rammer was found, which was inspected by detective
Woulard. Oye hearing of this circumstance, ordered Frost to
immediately take the pistol to which it belonged, and throw the
same into Dog River without delay, which was done accordingly.
In the confession of Frost, he further told where the pocket-book
of Stanley could be found that had been taken away from
him after death. Agreeable and true to his statement, the pocket-book
was found, and contained a tooth, which on seeing by Mr.
A. O’Donnell, was declared to belong to Mrs. Stanley—she
having before shown the same to him. With it a piece of poetry,
in the hand-writing of Stanley, was also found.”</p>

<p>The fact of Frost and Stanley boarding together at Oye’s
house; the fact of the murdered body having been found; the
fact of the sudden departure of Frost—before well-known to
have been in want of both money and respectable clothing, and
all at once, found with plenty, and then his falsehoods and
failure to account for the same; and then the fact of his confession
about the pocket-book having been proven to be perfectly
correct; these circumstances, with others connected, all taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
together, fasten guilt on Frost, and go far to establish the
truth of the other part of his confessions in which Oye is represented
as the principal actor of the whole.</p>

<p>Aware of all this when detective Woulard arrested Oye. He
placed both under a vigilant guard for a short time to be controlled
by Mr. A. F. Hooks. Immediately after the arrest was
made, Mrs. Oye got an opportunity to speak to her husband, and
was overheard to say something about a fuss, which in a few minutes
followed by her using such language of obscenity and profanity
against the guard which, perhaps, was never equalled
from the lips of woman. During the disturbance, the intention
was for Oye to get away, but the guard kept too sharp a lookout
for the attempt to succeed.</p>

<p>The prisoners were conveyed as soon as practicable by detective
Woulard, to St. Stevens, Alabama, where they had a
preliminary trial, and evidence sufficiently adduced for committal.
But all the while Mrs. Oye had been active. A writ of
Habeas Corpus had been obtained from the Circuit Judge of
the district, Mr. Elliott, requiring the prisoners forthwith to be
brought before him for a further hearing. In conformity with the
writ, the Sheriff of Washington county, E. L. Collins conveyed
them to Mobile, and the evidence there produced was sufficiently
strong for Judge Elliott to order them back to Washington
county to there await the action of the circuit court.</p>

<p>When the case came up for trial, by motion of counsel, a
change of venue was made: Oye’s case being removed to Baldwin
county, and Frost’s to the county of Mobile. Owing to the
great distance, with proportionate expenses, this change made
it very inconvenient for witnesses to attend, by reason of which
they were unable to be present in court, and the consequence
was a discharge of Oye for want of evidence; but last reports
say Frost still remains in Mobile jail—perhaps to be liberated
also when convenience of time will justify: thus defeating the
ends of justice and demonstrating the almost impossibility of
convicting any belonging to the worst class of criminals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>Since the forgoing was prepared for the press, the following
additional information has been received through a highly responsible
source from New Orleans, La.:</p>


<h3>MORE ABOUT FROST, “CALICO DICK’S” NEPHEW.</h3>

<p>“Frost shortly after the murder of W. C. Stanley, in Alabama,
made his appearance at Bay St. Louis, with two carpet bags
filled with fine clothing and his pockets full of money. He displayed
this ostentatiously, and spent it lavishly in the coffee
houses. While splurging in this style, he was arrested and
taken to Alabama, on the charge of murder. When he was
discharged (to the amazement of everybody) he returned to
the Bay, and by some means was made an assistant light-house
keeper on Chandlier Island: How he got in this position would
be well worth finding out. Recently the keeper sent him to
New Orleans to draw his (the keeper’s) money. Frost drew it,
and wrote to the keeper that he had deposited it with a certain
firm in the city. On inquiry, such deposit had not been
by him made, and he with the money disappeared some six
weeks ago. He and his uncle are capable of any crime, but are
cowards.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">August 13, 1874.</span></p>


<h3 id="NECESSARY_COMMENTS_ON_UNPUNISHED_CRIME">NECESSARY COMMENTS ON UNPUNISHED CRIME.</h3>

<p>Talk of reform and State improvements, impossible while
this system of things continue; “as well expect grapes from
thorns or figs from thistles.” Not occasional robberies, not
occasional murders alone that poison the vitals of society.
These will sometimes occur under the best government—under
good laws and well administered; it is the ninety-nine chances
for escape to one for conviction which produces so much evil.
When punishment is sure to immediately follow the commission
of crime, then society can repose in security; but otherwise,
the honest and peaceable live in fear—the dishonest and disorderly
in defiant lawlessness. Overt crime, regardless of law,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
with a determination to remain and risk all consequences from
the farcical courts; in such cases, arrest sometimes follow, but
the bail is ready, and with a few dollars acquittal will be almost
certain. If the case is too dark and unpopular, time after time
the trial will be put off, until, according to common parlance,
the case is worn out, or some material witness got out of the
way, and then the answer is “ready for trial”—well knowing
the result which must follow. But oftener, if the criminal
leave the county or State, no more notice is taken—no effort
made to reach and bring him back.</p>

<p>It is seldom that redress is ever endeavored to be obtained
by process of law. This reluctance cannot be wondered at in
the face of so many unblushing recommendations and encouragements
from unprincipled attorneys in open court to willful
violations of law; not to be wondered at when the injured
prosecutor experiences nothing but abuse and malicious, or
rather mercenary, invective, while the vile criminal is allowed
to walk out of court unhurt and plumed with the laurels of
victory, even in the worst cases which can possibly be conceived.
If one person becomes irritated against another, no
matter for what cause, either real or imaginary, he thinks not
of investigation in the courts, but either sets in to break up
his antagonist by private and malicious mischief, or he waylays,
ambushes or seeks an opportunity to create a quarrel, so
that life can be taken under the plea of justifiable homicide!
But sordid, corrupt and sinister motives do not always stop at
acquitting the guilty; they occasionally labor as hard to harrass
and punish the innocent! The author’s case, in his trial
at Mobile, is one instance out of many where everything was
strained to convict innocence. Sometimes one object in view,
and sometimes another. Grand juries are not unfrequently
acted on in a very disgraceful manner. One person, through
spite, or for getting the property of another in some covert
way, will seek an opportunity to get a bill from the grand jury.
Another, to avoid paying a just debt, or to screen himself in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
some other case, for the purpose of producing intimidation, or,
as it is more commonly called, “running him off,” will seek to
get a bill from the grand jury. Others, if the truth is too
plainly spoken, will seek to command the grand jury for <em>libel</em>.
Under such a system, the worst of men are generally the
most expert in law, and always the readiest to fly to it to subserve
their purposes. Alarming abuses in one direction seldom
fail to be carried on in the contrary direction pretty much
with equal proportion.</p>

<p>Lynch law is an unavoidable consequence of a mockery of
civil law. No nation can long prosper under a reign of court
corruptions. If the guilty, as a rule, escape, and justice not
strictly administered, the sources of wealth will soon languish
and decay. If the fashions of the courts are to favor the
worst at the expense of the best members of society, the necessary
results cannot fail to come shortly afterward. Under such
a deplorable state of things, confidence and security cannot
dwell. Suspicion and distrust everywhere; industry, the desire
to accumulate, and also productive capital, will all be
defective.</p>

<p>There are but few crimes which a determined and prudent
government cannot suppress. Those aggravated offenses under
the name of “Ku Klux” depredations, how soon they were put
down under a vigorous execution of law. If the government
of this State continues as it has begun, there will be no more of
dueling, or at least so rare as not to be productive of much
injury. The certainty of punishment, even in rare cases, will
relieve society from serious harm on this account.</p>

<p>States, Empires and Republics search for the first causes of
their decline and fall, and they will be found to consist in the
vitiated customs of the rulers in the various departments of
governments, in a reckless trampling on the principles of justice
without shame, without remorse, and, above all, in overgrown
corruptions practiced with the honors of emoluments
and distinctions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>And now it is only necessary to add, in reference to the
Wages and Copeland Clan, as an organization, it is broken up,
though isolated individuals who belonged to it still continue to
perpetrate crime whenever anything like a favorable opportunity
offers. For a lengthy duration of time this clan spread
terror and desolation both far and wide. Happily for present
society, as an organized body, it is numbered on the dark and
bloody pages of the past.</p>

<p>The publication of the confessions by the author was productive
of much good. The high and mighty outside aiders
severely felt the blows. But for the support given by such
auxiliary aiders the organization would have come to dissolution
much earlier. It is such influential aiders and abettors,
in warding off the chains of law, which give vitality to movements
of this character. The decline began from the death of
the President and leader, Wages, and also at the same time the
death of the preaching hypocrite, McGrath. This change was
further accelerated by the execution of Copeland, and the narrow
escape of another brother, together with the publication
of the confessions, laying open to public gaze the implicated
parties and the principal movement of the whole.</p>

<p>But the expiration of one sort of lawlessness does not preclude
the existence of others more dangerous, because more
subtle and more in accordance with the corruptions in the high
departments of States, and more in harmony with the operations
of those who boldly trample on rectitude and the laws of the
nation. Rings and cliques are not confined to political considerations
alone, but descend to many other important affairs
of life. A union of an inferior and unprincipled lawyer with a
subordinate officer, and these again with a league of reckless
and desperate “strikers,” who can make money almost at any
time from the honest earnings of the less expert, and all by
forms and processes of law. This is one class of rings complained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
of, the evils from which are of a frightful magnitude.
They weave the net, goad the honest but unwary into its
meshes, and revel on the spoils which have been extorted from
litigation. The former modes of robbery, plunder and murder
have, to a great extent, been superseded by, if possible, worse
evils in the form of a science as taught and practiced by these
rings and cliques. Crimes which formerly had to encounter
hardships and danger, can now be accomplished by other means
with honors, profits, and a plausible sanction of law. Government
should have power sufficient to be able and willing to
crush such proceedings, which, unchecked, must, ere long, produce
another national convulsion.</p>

<p>Copeland’s crimes were huge and many. Before he had
reached the meridian of life he paid the last and highest penalty
of the law. He was cut down anterior to the attainment of the
flower of his days—a melancholy example to all who prefer
robbery and murder to the honest and peaceful pursuits of industry.
With all the weight of crime belonging, he made some
atonement by his valuable confessions in the last hours of his
existence. It is not clear what were the actuating motives;
whether smarting under disappointment, and goaded on by a
spirit of revenge against those who had promised him safety
and protection, but did not prevent him enduring years of imprisonment
with the immediate prospect of a violent and ignominious
death, or sick of life, with no hope of earthly relief,
and oppressed with painful reflections on the past—conscious
that the affairs of this world could not concern him but a few
days longer—it is more than probable that the task of disclosing
the dreadful operations of his past life in associations
with others, afforded him some repose or satisfaction in the
unhappy situation he was then placed. With some, in the
condition of distress and despair, there is perhaps nothing
which can give a greater temporary relief than for the mind to
be intensely fixed and engaged on something which is to live
after the body has finished its earthly career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>No matter in what way the confessions may be put to the
test, they come out of the ordeal firmer and stronger than before.
They cannot be broken down in the severest conflicts in
organized courts for the purpose. A partisan Judge, supported
by a phalanx of talent and wealth, with all other influences
brought to bear, cannot, as has been tried, destroy nor impair
the invulnerable facts which they contain. Search for internal
evidences of truth, and they will be found in ample profusion.
Appeal to the last testimony of a dying man on the scaffold,
and it fully confirms the correctness of his confessions as made
some short time before. Ask numbers of still living witnesses
and they will vouch for the substantial accuracy of the facts as
related in these confessions. Call in time, the great arbiter of
disputes, and the revelations since made all go to corroborate
the validity of the work so obnoxious to the guilty implicated
in it.</p>

<p>If there are such occurrences as <em>special</em> acts of Providence,
the author of this work has certainly been favored. The numerous
snares set, the manifold plots laid for his life—these considered
and understood, and it is more than marvelous how he
has so far escaped destruction. Many devoted friends have
endeavored to dissuade him from the present object of publication,
because of the dangerous elements in high life which
affect society, but, for life or death, “the die is cast.” The
confidence in Providence, in prudence, and in the better portions
of society give him hope—conscious that whatever fate
the body may meet, truth will survive.</p>

<p>Long associations, official position, and many other causes
may prevent abler minds from grasping the evils which have
been only faintly touched on in this humble and unostentatious
work which is now submitted to the public. The thunders
and turbulent billows of criticism may play in wild warfare
against it, but simplicity and truth will finally prove more than
the match to sustain it.</p>

<p>The author has studiously avoided tinting any of his observations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
with preferences in favor of either of the conflicting
political parties of the day. He has indulged in no personal
considerations for the sake of revenge. He has constantly
kept in view public evils as they at present exist, and can see
no effective remedy from the triumph of either of the political
parties. The evils are fundamental, and require new combinations
to meet the exigencies of the times, and to prevent
further of intestine convulsion.</p>

<p>In concentrating, or giving additional <em>power</em>, the secret and
difficulty consist in preventing the <em>abuse</em> of this power. Not
in excessively frequent elections; not in the glowing descriptions
as given by Republican and Democratic orators and
writers, which have had their origin in the wild domains of
fancy; nor not in the harsh acerbitude which come from the
archives of despotism can the remedy be found to prevent the
abuse of power. All these have sufficiently been tried with a
melancholy failure. A form of government perhaps well
adapted to one stage in the progress of a nation, may, if continued,
prove fatal in a more advanced period of progression.</p>

<p>Let us hope that passions will subside within due bounds for
temperate reasons to mount the throne, so that this necessary
change can be accomplished without further effusions of blood—resulting
in permanent order, peace and prosperity for the
enjoyment of every class in this great and powerful nation.</p>
